0,i_want_batteries,"Taking the definition of Judaical activism as:Court rulings made based on political or personal views of the judges presiding over the case.The reading I have of Shelby v. Holder is basically that the majority justices decided that the voting rights act in the year 2013 unconstitutionally violated the principle of federalism by nature of it being too out of date. The majority of them conceded that congress has the power to pass this lay to enforce the 14th and 15th amendment, but claimed that it was too out of date, so we should throw it out. Given that they conceded that this violation of federalism was allowed, but they just thought it was too old, and that it had been re-approved by congress just 6 years earlier, it was a blatant attempt to impose their own personal or political views onto US law. Chief Justice Roberts writes "" There is no denying, however, that
the conditions that originally justified these measures no
longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions""but that claim is not in fact undeniable. The arguments he presents that they are undeniable are the same arguments one would use to present that the voting rights act is working. He even writes that voting discrimination exists. The picking apart of the statute and striking of formulas and methods, rather than the denial of the power of congress to enact such laws show how the court was applying it's own opinions on voter suppression rather than the opinions of the legislature.

Lets throw out 40 years of precedent for the sole reason being we don\'t like it, bringing complete chaos to thousands of existing contracts in the process. We\'ll call union dues ""compelled speach"" making it a first amendment violation, depriving the legislature of any remedy short of a constitutional amendment. Further, let\'s premptively rule an opt-out mechanism is also unconstitutional and require explicit opt-in for no other reason than it makes union organizing harder.\n', 'Reading into it now, but this seems to be a ""conservative"" ruling, making it unlikely to change my view, as my statement is that there are no liberal rulings more activist.\nEdit: given a solid argument I am willing to give out deltas that this is a better example, but I really do want to understand the conservative argument around judicial activism.\n', '\nbut I really do want to understand the conservative argument around judicial activism.\n\nThe belief around judicial activism is the judiciary ignoring the Constitution in favor of results-based outcomes rather than constitutional ones.  This is primarily a liberal problem because of the beliefs surrounding the ""living document"" style of Constitutional interpretation, which largely eschews the plain text in favor of other needs.\nThis is not to say that the conservative justices do not engage on this from time to time, but as most conservative jurisprudence is based around the idea of reading the document as written, it isn\'t typical.\nSo when we bring it around to Shelby, I find your protest to be weird.    The ruling was not that the law itself was out of date, but instead the data underpinning it to be out of date.  The law was not struck down (because the Constitution allows Congress to pass legislation to address deficiencies in this area), but instead the law was made nonfunctional until Congress provides an updated data set to use.\nThis is basically the opposite of judicial activism, as they used the text of the Constitution to interpret the law in a dispute between two government entities.\nEven if we were to accept Shelby as activism, I would argue that Kelo v. New London is a much, much worse example of judicial activism than Shelby in every way.  Not only did the ruling ignore the text, but it was so grossly misruled that multiple states quickly passed laws to prohibit what the ruling set out to allow, both red and blue.  It was one of the grossest miscarriages of justice in recent memory, and was steered into place by the liberal wing of the court.\nI would also have you consider Obergefell as a much worse example, in part because it is an example of a positive policy result coming from judicial activism even while it breaks the Constitution.  The abuse of substantive due process on the Supreme Court has been a long-standing problem, and I absolutely recommend Clarence Thomas\'s dissent in this case as well as his other writings on substantive due process for more information on this.\n', 'I like Kelo vs. New London as a framework here. SO let me frame the facts here.\nThe 5th amendment says ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation""\nAs there is no enumerated power for taking of property for private use, the city of New London used this to justify their taking of private property for ""public"" use of urban renewal or somesuch.\nOn it\'s face that is hard to justify as public use, but even granting that it granted the government rights, but still allowed legislatures room to respond by outlawing taking of property in this manner. Now, Shelby also presumably allows the legislature to respond, assuming the court doesn\'t just strike it down again.\nThis expansion of powers of legislatures seems to be significant, and covering one of the core purposes of the constitution.\nHow do you think personal or political views fit into this? Interestingly this is a pro-business ruling (in it\'s individual facts) that was primarily driven by liberal justices, do you think that is relevant to determining how much of activism it is?\n', '\nHow do you think personal or political views fit into this? Interestingly this is a pro-business ruling (in it\'s individual facts) that was primarily driven by liberal justices, do you think that is relevant to determining how much of activism it is?\n\nNo, because it\'s not a ""pro-business"" ruling, it\'s a pro-government ruling.  The government in New London was, at least according to the framing the left prefers, working in favor of a private business, Pfizer, although New London argued that they were working for the public in expanding the tax base.  \nSo when we look at what the ruling was, which was one that expanded government power beyond what was intended or understood by ""eminent domain,"" it\'s absolutely an ideological left/right thing, and it was the left that was, as expected from an ideology that seeks more government power and seeks a broad, ""living"" interpretation of the Constitution, pushing for the ""activist"" result. \nYou talk a lot about allowing the government to respond, but that doesn\'t mean much.  The states have immense power to regulate how it decides to exercise its rights, but even if a state constrains itself, the federal government has still said, thanks to Kelo, that they retain the right to use eminent domain as New London did.  In Shelby, the government did not lose any powers or become constrained in any meaningful way outside of being told ""keep your data up to date if you are going to legislate using data.""  The legislature ""can respond"" because the ruling was fundamentally legislative in scope.  It\'s not really the same thing, which is also why Kelo was decidedly more activist than Shelby, because Kelo expanded government power beyond intended scope while Shleby did not impact government power at all. \nAs an overall aside, the idea of a ""pro-business"" or ""pro-individual"" ruling is probably one that should be discarded in legal discussions overall.  A business or corporate entity is nothing more than the people who constitute its ownership (which is why ""corporate personhood"" is such an important legal precept), and pretending the interests are at odds absolutely feed into perceptions about the courts and its motivations.  \n', ""Corporate person-hood is a terrible legal precept that leaves actors entirely un-accountable for the actions behind the corporate veil.

It rejects a fundamental power as outlined in the constitution (properly ownership only being limited by government takings under article 5). It does not constrain anybody, and gives wide berth for far reaching government action outside of the constitution, and not textually backed up by anything.

It didn't shield bankers after the crash.  \nI do not know how you can have corporate structures without corporate personhood.  You cannot constrain individuals from speaking simply because of how they organize, and you cannot argue that organized groups, for example, should not be secure in their papers.  We agree that it should not be used to remove/end accountability, but that comes across more as one of those persistent myths rather than how it works in reality.\n"", 'Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/ClockOfTheLongNow (9∆).\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n', 'How is judges interpreting data and deciding that the legislature got the interpretation wrong more constitutional (as written)?

It was a 2006 law using 1975 information, which is not reasonable for any group involved, and was the reason the ruling went the way it did.  To quote from Alito\'s majority ruling, ""Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.""

Voting rights cases (like, say, Marion County) are less activist due to their base reliance on constitutional language.\nI am strongly in favor of the legality of gay marriage, but I have a lot of trouble finding a federal constitutional justification for it, and the main foundational points of the majority ruling is not convincing.

The only difference between between Abboud and Janus is the justices hearing the case. From Kagan\'s dissent: ""The majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this Nation’s law—and in its economic life—for over 40 years. As a result, it prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance.” and ""But the worse part of today’s opinion is where the majority subverts all known principles of stare decisis.

The court, through its conservative activist judges, made all government jobs right to work, meaning people may work without paying any form of union fees, including ""fair share"" negoitiating fees of non-members in the bargaining unit. Effectively creating a free-rider problem for unions. Further, they tied this decision to the first amendment, meaning there is no legislative fix short of a constitutional amendment.

Judicial activism is the act of looking beyond the text to get to a better result.  Janus, like Citizens United, was one of those clear cases that, if one side was not regularly engaging in judicial activism, should have been 9-0 in favor rather than the 5-4 they ended up.\n"", 'Interesting, so you think that Janus was not activist judges limiting the capabilities of legislatures, but protecting certain kinds of speech or association (including non speech and non-association) If the bargaining agreement was that the fees were paid by the company, and non-union members were paid the same amount less would that be non-speech, or non-association?\n', '\nInteresting, so you think that Janus was not activist judges limiting the capabilities of legislatures, but protecting certain kinds of speech or association (including non speech and non-association)\n\nThe Constitution itself limits the capabilities of legislatures.  The Constitution is designed to constrain the government, so Janus cannot be ""activist"" by the nature of the structure of the Constitution when it comes to the ruling that it came to.\nThose who call Janus activist are pointing to the precedent it overturned without understanding or acknowledging that the precedent they cite was, in all likelihood, incorrect.  Those who seek a more active government also prefer ""living document"" jurisprudence because it is deferential to legislative activities and empowers the government to act outside of its constitutionally-constrained bounds.  So instead of seeing Janus for what it is (a case involving free speech and free association), they see it for what it does to a government that they want to see active in the realm of labor rights.  It\'s outcome-based rather than based in the Constitution.\n\nIf the bargaining agreement was that the fees were paid by the company, and non-union members were paid the same amount less would that be non-speech, or non-association?\n\nThis would raise a different question as to whether bargaining fees paid by the company would improperly inhibit free association or free speech rights of those companies, but Janus had to do specifically with public sector employee labor unions, and did not apply to private sector ones.

70\'s, and referenced in dozens of cases since. Local and state governments across the land developed contracts with their workers, with the union believing Abboud protected them. There have been no new facts introduced since Abboud to warrant overturning. (Unlike in Brown v. Board where signifcant other case law had shown ""seperate but equal"" was anything but.) The only difference between between Abboud and Janus is the justices hearing the case. From Kagan\'s dissent: ""The majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this Nation’s law—and in its economic life—for over 40 years. As a result, it prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance.” and ""But the worse part of today’s opinion is where the majority subverts all known principles of stare decisis. The majority makes plain, in the first 33 pages of its decision, that it believes Abood was wrong. But even if that were true (which it is not), it is not enough."" On the impact to contracts, ""Still more, thousands of current contracts covering millions of workers provide for agency fees. Usually, this Court recognizes that “[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. Not today. The majority undoes bargains reached all over the country. It prevents the parties from fulfilling other commitments they have made based on those agreements. It forces the parties—immediately—to renegotiate once-settled terms and create new tradeoffs. It does so knowing that many of the parties will have to revise (or redo) multiple contracts simultaneously.""\nIf this is not describe judicial activism in its most egregious form, I do not know what rlse does.\n', '\nbut I really do want to understand the conservative argument around judicial activism.\n\nThe belief around judicial activism is the judiciary ignoring the Constitution in favor of results-based outcomes rather than constitutional ones.  This is primarily a liberal problem because of the beliefs surrounding the ""living document"" style of Constitutional interpretation, which largely eschews the plain text in favor of other needs.\nThis is not to say that the conservative justices do not engage on this from time to time, but as most conservative jurisprudence is based around the idea of reading the document as written, it isn\'t typical.\nSo when we bring it around to Shelby, I find your protest to be weird.    The ruling was not that the law itself was out of date, but instead the data underpinning it to be out of date.  The law was not struck down (because the Constitution allows Congress to pass legislation to address deficiencies in this area), but instead the law was made nonfunctional until Congress provides an updated data set to use.\nThis is basically the opposite of judicial activism, as they used the text of the Constitution to interpret the law in a dispute between two government entities.\nEven if we were to accept Shelby as activism, I would argue that Kelo v. New London is a much, much worse example of judicial activism than Shelby in every way.  Not only did the ruling ignore the text, but it was so grossly misruled that multiple states quickly passed laws to prohibit what the ruling set out to allow, both red and blue.  It was one of the grossest miscarriages of justice in recent memory, and was steered into place by the liberal wing of the court.\nI would also have you consider Obergefell as a much worse example, in part because it is an example of a positive policy result coming from judicial activism even while it breaks the Constitution.  The abuse of substantive due process on the Supreme Court has been a long-standing problem, and I absolutely recommend Clarence Thomas\'s dissent in this case as well as his other writings on substantive due process for more information on this.\n']",60.24,"[[68.26, 50.87, 40.01, 45.19, 50.87, 41.23, 40.55, 56.96, 57.43, 41.4, 42.24, 50.87, 55.88, 48.74, 64.3, 37.13, 53.41, 72.16, 59.84, 6.18, 41.43, 51.55, 69.82, 74.35, 51.72, 44.07, 62.68, 66.57, 72.9, 60.55, 64.37, 89.75, 58.42, 70.23, 70.97, 40.31, 77.57], [68.26, 50.87, 40.01, 45.19, 50.87, 41.23, 40.55, 56.96, 57.43, 41.4, 42.24, 50.87, 55.88, 48.74, 64.3, 37.13, 53.41, 72.16, 59.84, 6.18, 41.43, 51.55, 69.82, 74.35, 51.72, 44.07, 62.68, 66.57, 72.9, 60.55, 64.37, 89.75, 58.42, 70.23, 70.97, 40.31, 77.57]]"
1,asianviolinist98,"I do not believe Affirmative Action should be a thing. The standards should not be lowered just because of race or socioeconomic status. Last year when i was applying to college I used to frequent r/applyingtocollege and college confidential. There were many high achieving,motivated people with impressive stats who knew what they wanted to do in life. I was one of those people. 5s in 14 AP exams, high 1500s on the SAT, 4.0, valedictorian, accomplished violinist( for a high schooler) and had done great in science olympiads. Yet many of us were rejected. I am not salty about that. They say more there are more qualified candidates than the school can fit. Ok I get that. They say they could fill their rooms with all valedictorians/ people with perfect on the SAT but that is not what they are looking for. What I don't get is accepting people with 3.5 GPA and a 27 on the ACT because they black  and rejecting someone else who wants the same major, has a 36 ACT, 4.0 GPA and has actually shown passion towards that major.I don't get the excuse at all. Some say that minorities tend to lack resources. Even schools like Uchicago are starting to be test optional because of this excuse. People say standardized testing results is determined on wealth. I believe that is true only if the person is dirt poor and lives in absolute poverty. I am not super rich, did not have tutors, did not go to a private school, and my high school wasn't that great either. The only reason I achieved a 99th percentile score was because I spent hour upon hours using free resources on the internet like r/sat, Khan Academy's 8 practice test or however many it is now, free pdf's of Erica Meltzer's critical reading and grammar books and a free pdf of College Panda's math book. For AP's I just self studied them using youtube and  past AP exams I got online for fee. The SAT is a basic test. The hardest level of math on there is Precalc and the writing section only test a couple of grammar/stylistic rules. The only ""difficult"" section is reading because it is less formulaic. I do not buy the argument that ""low income"" people who have access to internet(which they would need to apply to T20 schools) lack resources to do well on standardized testing. It comes down to practice, effort and determination. Same with GPA.Top universities provide invaluable connections, research opportunities and resources. Big investment banks recruit solely in target schools.  Why should someone with low GPA and standardized test scores have a decent opportunity to get into Wall Street because of their race while someone who has higher stats and has done more academically but is white or asian have virtually no shot ?Why does someone who got a 3 on AP Physics C and did atrocious on the SAT have more research opportunities for Physics solely because of race or socioeconomic status than one who got a 5 on the AP exam, did well in Physics competition and basically breathes Physics.I believe undergrad T20 universities should only accept  demonstrably academically qualified people.Same thing for graduate schools. it disturbs me that med schools perform affirmative action. It is essential our doctors be qualified. Med school should be based on merit and so should law schools and other graduate schools.I am willing to change my view on this issue though","['DeltaBot', 'cacheflow', 'asianviolinist98', 'makr28', 'wisebloodfoolheart', 'DeltaBot', 'brickbacon', 'healthy_horny_hayley', 'asianviolinist98', 'IDrutherBeReading', 'smellslikebadussy', 'asianviolinist98', 'smellslikebadussy', 'mtbarz', 'asianviolinist98', 'mtbarz', 'NUMBERS2357', 'begonetoxicpeople', 'rjk42', 'AutoModerator', 'lexayraee', 'asianviolinist98', 'Mangiafuoc0', 'wisebloodfoolheart', 'Supplemehntal']","[""/u/asianviolinist98 (OP) has awarded 1 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""\nI believe undergrad T20 universities should only accept demonstrably academically qualified people.\n\nI disagree.

Your issue is that you see this as more of a right and entitlement than you do something you might be given under a very specific set of circumstances. That’s essentially the reason you and others feel it’s valid to use a quantitative analysis to argue you “earned” or “deserved” something that someone else who received it did not. \nAnd it don’t want to put it all on you. I think the colleges themselves have often ginned up this sort of entitlement, and fundamentally limited the supply in a way that is problematic,  but it’s fundamental incorrect as far as college admissions goes these days. To analogize, it would be like getting angry that someone won’t date you despite the fact you have more positive qualities than their current SO. \nThat said, let’s also talk about why your attitude is generally a problem. We can argue all day about the metrics,  but almost to a person, these schools are not admitting unqualified people regardless of color or socioeconomic status. They are almost all exceptional and capable of success. Even when there is a statistically significant quantitative gap in scores, you don’t see a meaningful qualitative gap in potential outcomes based on raw skills alone. \nTwo, the issue of affirmative action is often framed as one where talented Asian and White students suffer because of Black and Hispanic underachievement without consideration of the facts that: those two things are connected, and that White women have been the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action. \nTo address the latter point first, few people argue when colleges (rightfully imo) completely redesign the CS curriculum to help women, or when they (rightfully imo) specifically recruit women or redesign their campuses to make them safer for women. All of that is done to level the playing field so that women can thrive and achieve their potential. Much of that falls under the umbrella of affirmative action strictly speaking, but the gains of women are rarely seen as, and perpetually litigated as, the reason more “talented” (male) students cannot get a fair shake despite women being more numerous, and often more to the “detrimental” to this quantitative egalitarian system you seem to idealize. Not to digress, but just an FYI, such a system would mean Harvard would be something like 95% foreign born students mostly from India and China, something I see almost no one advocate. \nMuch of the time, the reason these issues are viewed differently is because of how we view race in this country. Even people who are not racist are poisoned by this pervasive ideology. The fact is that we are here debating whether Black and Brown people deserve something that were judiciously given by people we generally acknowledge are among the most capable of training and evaluating talent. Yet, those bonafides mean little if they deign to give a Black kid an opportunity? Does that really make sense to you? The Harvards of the world are the best at what they do, yet they are deliberately kneecapping themselves by knowingly admitting inferior students? And the market hasn’t punished them by limited their pool of applicants? Why would you even want to go to these schools you think are both stupid and racist?\nIt only makes sense in a world where Black achievement is assumed to be unearned, where Hispanic students are seen as un-American, and where racial grievances, inequities, and discrimination are assumed to have been corrected absent any significant reparations or effective corrective policies. It only makes sense in a world where it’s fine for a school to reward or acknowledge playing a violin, being raised in a unique city, being a good interviewee, having trauma that contributes to a compelling essay, or having poor parents, all things that are largely orthogonal to academic achievement, but not to racial background (as a corrective and a signal) despite that attribute still highly correlating with all sorts of things in life. \nI get it, it sucked to have had your hard work deemed insufficient. It might even suck more when you think someone else get what you coveted, and didn’t work as hard and isn’t as smart. That might even be true, but it’s a terrible and frustrating problematic way of looking at the world. You will be constantly disappointed if you think the world is a machine that parcels out opportunities and outcomes based anything that resembles fairness strictly speaking. \nInstead, you should be demanding that schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford stop artificially limiting the number of slots they have. Don’t focus so much on the gatekeeper, focus on the size of the gate (or even the gate itself). The fact that these elite institutions might every now and then admit an much “less qualified” PoC is far less of a scandal than the fact that they have limited supply to an extent that they are rejecting thousands upon thousands of highly qualified kids despite sitting on tens of billions of dollars in tax-exempt endowment funds. You should focus less and affirmative action, and demand that they function more like the elite training institutions they claim to be, and less like a selective country club.\n', 'I see your point, however, there are many other factors to consider. For example, it’s important to recognize that good grades in a traditional secondary school does not equal the highest IQ or level of intelligence. The same goes for high test scores.\nAdditionally, many students of color from low income neighborhoods not only lack resources like college prep courses, SAT tutors, or SAT books, but they also often do not have internet access in their homes. You might argue that they could go to a public library etc. to access a computer, but you’re not taking into account that many of these children have to help their families financially ON TOP OF being a full time student. It is impossible for a student in this situation to compete with someone who has their own computer, food on the table every night without question, a safe and quiet STABLE home, no siblings to take care of, and more. \nThere are so many factors that disproportionately and negatively affect people of color. It is important to consider that for the larger good of society and the promotion of “equality” of races in America, students with high intelligence and potential from low income areas have the same opportunities as their white peers.  It’s not exactly realistic to consider that just because white student A has a higher GPA and SAT score, she is smarter than black student B who DESPITE all of her potential struggles, challenges and trauma in her childhood, she was still able to thrive.\nClarification: Of course, not all people of color are poor or struggling. However, people of color are disproportionately at lower socioeconomic statuses and marginalized. \n', '\nFor example, it’s important to recognize that good grades in a traditional secondary school does not equal the highest IQ or level of intelligence.

But if/when they are at universities, their environment will (hopefully) change, and they will have a better chance to succeed in school.\nTo this and the next quote (""It is important to consider that for the larger good of society and the  promotion of “equality” of races in America, students with high  intelligence and potential from low income areas have the same  opportunities as their white peers."")\nThings are fairer and people are better off with racial equality, so it\'s important to do what we can to even out people\'s opportunities succeed in school.\n', ""I don’t believe for a second that the truly elite schools admit anyone with a 27 ACT or the equivalent SAT, regardless of race (short of athletics, which is a separate issue).\nHarvard, for example, admits 2,000 people a year. Assume for the sake of argument that virtually every elite student in America applies there. Now consider that in 2017, U.S. ACT scores included:\n--2,800 who scored 36\n--12,000 who scored 35\n--21,000 who scored 34\nSo, even if they drew a line at 35 (which they don't), they'd be rejecting six out of every seven candidates.\nEverybody who is applying to these universities got straight A's or very close to it. What that means is that, in effect, EVERY admissions spot is being decided by subjective, non-academic factors. And I would bet folding money that where you do see ACTs in the range of 34 or (gasp!) 33, it's a legacy student whose parents have donated large amounts to the university. \n"", 'There are definitely sub 30 ACT going to top colleges.\n', 'Not in any kind of significant numbers. 99.99 percent of admits at elite U.S. universities, as well as the next two or three tiers of rejected candidates, have profiles that are exactly the same in all objective measurements. You could not find a meaningful difference in ""qualifications"" among the top 15,000 people who apply for those 2,000 spots. Choosing between students at that level is throwing darts - or, more likely, finding people with wealthy families who will be big donors. If they can find space for marginal (for that level) students with potential to bring money to the school, what’s wrong with saving a few spots for students who might have done slightly worse on one of two specific tests but have shown in other ways that they have something the university is looking for? We’re not talking about people who are manifestly unqualified for good colleges here. \n', 'I\'m not going to argue for/against AA. However, I do want to address the claims you\'re making about standardized testing.\n\nDo you think that there are a large number of people who are getting in with piss poor academic scores? \nStandardized tests act to measure ""are you capable of this school?"", not ""are you the smartest?"". If Harvard wanted to, they could just admit the highest GPAs they see. But instead, they want to look at an entire applicant--they check scores at a certain level to see if the person is capable (and it seems that they\'re fairly good at deciding on this--how many people drop out of Harvard or are forced out because of academics?). \nDo you really think that spending a few hours a week to get a 99th percentile SAT is as worthwhile as spending a few hours a week practicing an instrument, working a part time job to support your family, etc.?

The MIT dean of admissions even thinks so (https://news.mit.edu/2016/stu-schmill-endorses-consideration-of-character-in-college-admissions-0120). \n"", 'So, what do you think schools should admit people based on?  You say elsewhere in this thread that it should not just be intelligence, but they should also reward hard work.\nSay a white or Asian kid is rejected in favor of a black kid who had worse test scores/grades/whatever.  How do you know the rejected kid worked harder?  Hard work doesn\'t always translate into better grades - Harvard rejects plenty of hard workers who just can\'t cut it.  Nor extracirriculars, which depends heavily on the school.\nYou say you worked hard in high school - a black kid who gets in partly due to affirmative action, how do you know he wasn\'t working hard?  What\'s that based on?\nFurther, how much hard work you do isn\'t just a question of innate drive.  It\'s a question of environment.  Kids from rich fancy prep schools go to, and are overrepresented in, elite colleges worked hard in high school.  In fact, the whole reason they\'re called ""prep"" schools is that they ""prepare"" you for college - by giving you a lot of work so you\'re ready for it.  Many kids don\'t work as hard because they\'re not surrounded by people telling them to, and/or because nobody has told them that if they work hard they\'ll be rewarded for it.\nThis means that if you take someone who ""didn\'t work as hard"" in high school and put them in a good college, there\'s a good chance they will start working hard.\n\nAnyway, the real truth of it is, everyone who goes to these schools is academically qualified.  There\'s just many more academically qualified kids than there are spots.  Measuring intelligence or hard work is hard to do anyway, harder to do in high schoolers; and it\'s harder still to predict how the things they did in high school translates into what they\'ll do in college, any beyond.\nIt\'s all a big hair-splitting crapshoot.\n', 'How many extracurriculars did you do? Based on what you said, it sounds like you mostly studied- and good for you! But schools, even the top tier ones, want more than just a high test score. They want people who do extracurriculars, who go out of their way to do stuff other than school. In my experience, having a lot of extracurriculars can show dedication and a more open mindedness, so schools will tend to like students who have those and slightly above average scores than students who have perfect scores but no other experiences listed on an application\n', 'Something that struck me most from your post was that you claim you got a 99th percentile score because you spent ""hour upon hours using free resources on the internet."" The mere existence of these hours and hours is clearly a privilege already; I assume that you did not have to work to support your family, for example. So was your score an indicator of your ""academic preparation"" and ""passion towards your major""? Or was it more of an indicator of the time available to you to study for tests that really have nothing to do with what life will be like after college?\nBut to the larger ideas behind your post, I am a college professor at a liberal arts college. As a teen, I was very much the type of student you have described (and I think, you are claiming to be). Studied for standardized tests practically for fun, perfect GPA, notable success in extracurriculars. However, upon being employed the college environment and learning more about how people learn and grow, I see what a narrow definition of ""success"" or ""preparation"" this is. I have many students who are excellent on paper in this way, but don\'t know how to deal with failure, are too afraid to try new risks, and have perfected ""the game"" of high school grade success such that they flounder when approached with new expectations in college. The real world is not all about points and tests; they really don\'t exist in other contexts. There are so many other ways to demonstrate your passion (to use your words) than in test scores. Some would argue, the time you spent studying for standardized tests could have been better spent actually engaging in the subject in a real-world context. Therefore I would ask you to strongly reconsider the idea that a lower GPA or test scores is really a ""lowering of standards"" - that\'s only true if test scores are the only standards worth considering. In the real world, after high school and college, they really truly don\'t matter.\nI would also caution you against using online college application boards to make judgments about what goes on ""behind the scenes"" in the admissions process. Of course students are only going to post their ""high scores"" (again using the gamification analogy) and use this as evidence of discrimination when they are not accepted. This is likely not the full picture. Can they write a coherent, thoughtful, passionate, unique essay? What do their recommenders say? That probably won\'t show up in the discussion boards.\nAnd, I guess I am a bit curious - why do you think only the ""top"" universities should not consider things like race - does that mean you think other universities should?\n', ""Note: Your thread has not been removed.\nYour post's topic seems to be fairly common on this subreddit.

Maybe you are unqualified.\n"", ""When colleges decide who to admit, they're trying to guess at the future potential of the student, not just their current level of achievement. For some students, this means taking into account the disadvantages they faced in high school and how well they might  be expected to do if those disadvantages were removed. You may think you had no advantages, but you at least had the free time to learn on your own. A student who had to, say, help out in her dad's store every minute she wasn't at school, or take care of a disabled mother, or watch baby siblings, wouldn't have had that time. But if they went away to college, it's possible to estimate how much better they could be expected to do if they already did quite well with the handicap.\nNow, if an admissions board is going to do that kind of predictive thinking, I don't think it's right to simply glance at the student's race and make assumptions. Because, well, it's racist to assume all black people are impoverished or fatherless. I'm not even sure you can tell just by looking at the number in the annual family income column, because it doesn't take into account personal factors like if there are helpful grandparents involved, or Dad is a drunk who spilled beer on his son's term papers. If you are going to admit a student with slightly worse grades, you had better have a good reason for believing that specific student had some removable stumbling block in their way thus far, and they're going to start doing much better once their parents drop them off on that beautiful college campus. If one kid writes his 'overcoming challenges' personal essay about the time his pencil broke, and another writes about being homeless sophomore year, that's a piece of data that's relevant, and of course they're going to factor it in. But at that point I'm not sure it counts as affirmative action in the way you mean. It's just the same thing they do to every application: reading between the lines, analyzing what they know about you, and applying their considerable experience to decide whether you're a good bet or not.\n"", 'Are you aware that the average white household has 8x the net worth of the average black household?

They chose to delay confirmation temporarily to hold further hearings. The confirmation process was on track to be faster than most recent confirmations, and would certainly be finished before newly elected Senators take office in January. Delaying for a week or two did not seem unreasonable.The Senate chose to have both Ford and Kavanaugh testify. This is in line with public statements by Trump, Kavanaugh, and officials from both parties. This part certainly seems reasonable.Senate Democrats asked Kavanaugh about tangentially related subjects that may say something about his character or candor (eg. his statements about a Clinton-backed conspiracy, his explanation of a yearbook caption, accounts from his time at Yale). This led to some goofy sound bites about butt chugging, but it was reasonable for Senators to ask these questions. Character and candor are important qualities in a judge, and Senators should consider any evidence they can to evaluate a nominee.Republicans and Democrats agreed to an FBI investigation to see if Ford's testimony could be corroborated. The investigation was reportedly unable to turn up anything solid, which isn't surprising considering the alleged incident occurred about 30 years ago. Had the investigation netted witness testimony that the assault did occur, which was a possibility going in, then presumably that would have tanked Kavanaugh's nomination. Since that was not found, the report is inconclusive.The Senate proceeded to a final vote. Some might consider this hasty after the short investigation, but realistically the chances of such an investigation into a 30 year old incident was never very likely to turn up evidence even if we assume the event did occur. Extending the investigation even longer seems excessive. If we give Senators the benefit of the doubt, then we presume they cast their decision based on what they think of Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy overall, whether they believed his testimony, and his handling of questions. This led Democrats to vote against him (his judicial philosophy generally runs against theirs and he lashed out at them during questioning) and Republicans to vote for him (his judicial philosophy is in line with theirs and he was very cooperative with them).That's overall how I saw this process playing out. Yet, I keep hearing people get very worked up about how it was either an abomination of justice because Kavanaugh was treated as guilty without evidence, or an abomination of justice because Ford was written off.

What should happen after an allegation is an investigation to see if they actually have any merit or truth to them.\nNow my understanding is that while an FBI investigation was conducted, the scope of the investigation was limited by the White House meaning they couldn\'t ask key questions or speak to key leads.  Now, had a full investigation been done where no stone was left unturned I don\'t think they\'d be much to complain about.  If the man is innocent, he\'s innocent.  But the limited scope thing really rubbed me the wrong way.  It just doesn\'t seem right that the FBI were muzzled in such a way that they can\'t follow every single lead, after all this is the Supreme Court we\'re talking about.  Literally the highest court in the land with life appointments given the power to interpret and reinterpret our nation\'s constitutions.  The problem I have is that now regardless of whether he\'s actually guilty or innocent of the allegations there will always be doubt.  Was there no evidence and he\'s actually innocent of the allegations or was the investigation so gutted they couldn\'t make a case against him despite their being evidence?\nThe frustrating bit is that we spent over 2 years investigating Hillary Clinton for Benghazi.  Hell, that\'s more time than the US spent investigating 9/11.  Secretary of State is no joke, but I think most people would agree that a Supreme Court Justice wields more influence over our nation.  I\'m not auguring that Kavanaugh\'s investigation should have run as long, but you can understand the disparagement between the two.  A 2 year+ investigation into Secretary of State (4 year position) but hardly a week can be spared for a potential justice (lifetime position)?  It feels hypocritical that when it was a democrat, republicans were all for leaving no stone unturned, following any and all leads, and that no cost was too high in pursuit of the truth.  And then when it\'s their guy on the line it\'s suddenly, ""can\'t ask those questions, can\'t talk to those leads, and hurry it up"". As a casual observer it feels as if they did a complete 180 in regards to their investigating.\nWhether this is fact or not, at least to me and some others, it feels as if the only reason the investigation existed was so that republicans would have something legitimate to point, totally ignoring the fact that the investigation was more or less set up to be toothless. \nMe personally, I\'m very frustrated that there were any restrictions at all on the FBI investigations.  For an appointment as monumental as SC Justice I just can\'t understand why we wouldn\'t want the investigation to be as though and complete as possible just so that at the end of the day there would be no questions as to whether the man was innocent or guilty.

He was selected because of a relationship with Kennedy, who wanted him as his successor. The GOP could absolutely have dropped Brett and replaced him with say, Amy Barrett, who I also think is judicially horrifying, but she's unlikely to have credible accusations of being a rapist.\nAnd that is what it comes down to, on principle. Democrats were firmly aware that if Brett got kicked, the GOP had months to nominate and confirm a replacement. They (except for Manchin who voted 'I want to get re-elected') voted on principle against the accused rapist, under the argument that you probably shouldn't be on the supreme court if you have that hanging over your head, that the institution is more important than any one nominee.\nThe GOP, by contrast, just don't fucking care.\nNowhere was this more apparent than Susan Collins. She gave a 45 minute speech, which ended with the tag line of 'I believe Ford was assaulted, but I don't believe it was Kavanaugh.'\nThe GOP as a whole wanted to have their cake and eat it too.

Most importantly they could have refused to consent to a guy who probably did try and rape multiple women.

At the end of the day Kavanaugh has not been found guilty of sexual assault. There is the potential to set a social precedent that anyone can have their political career stopped dead in its tracks without convincing evidence. Of course, the definition of convincing varies, but apparently many in the GOP did not find what was presented as convincing.

3,Cybyss,"My view is that any meal which ordinarily contains lettuce would be made better if the lettuce was replaced by cabbage. This includes things like salads, tacos, sandwiches, and hamburgers.Why, you may ask? I've had good, freshly picked lettuces and cabbages from a local farm. Both taste way better than anything you'd get in a grocery store, but the cabbage is still invariably sweeter, crispier, and more flavorful than the lettuce - all desirable qualities for salads and sandwiches. I realize that some varieties of cabbage can be quite stiff, so their texture may seem awkward in a salad, but the leafy part of a Napa/Chinese cabbage has a texture that is closer to that of lettuce for when you need less stiffness.Another aspect which makes cabbage superior is that, unlike lettuce, you can cook cabbage! Cut it into nice strips and put it in a stir fry, or boil it to make Polish gloomkies or a nice Irish 'Corned Beef & Cabbage' meal. You can also pickle it to make sauerkraut. Thus, not only would cabbage be better in meals we normally use lettuce for, cabbage can be made into a wide range of many other meals that you simply can't use lettuce in!How can you change my view? Well, name something that you can do with lettuce that you can't with cabbage, or a meal containing lettuce that really would be awkward with cabbage instead.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

5,tastytoby,"This argument is the epitome of subjectivity, but I thought I'd see what you guys think anyways.Reasons for my position: Orwell's prose may not be as incredibly detailed as Joseph Conrad's or Virginia Woolf's when it comes to squeezing meaning into each word, but it's not vague or empty by any means. This makes his style slightly more appealing and readable, at least in my eyes. The figurative language and thematic messaging that Orwell does throw in throughout 1984 and Animal Farm has several levels of possible understanding. One can read Winston and Julia's relationship as a quasi-Biblical, semi-Shakespearean allegory, or as in itself a rather violent lesson in morality, human psychology, and pragmatics. Orwell's writing is still highly readable and enjoyable even when one chooses to read simply for plot.  This is but one slim example--as any readers of his know, Orwell is capable of many, many more. Orwell had a very particular affinity for predicting the future. I'm not saying that any significant element of the world he created in 1984 came true, just that as a thinker he was more capable than any of his contemporaries of observing his political and economic surroundings, and turning them into a work of prose that remains relevant and intelligible decades later. Orwell's essays, and his chronicles of the Spanish Civil War in Homage to Catalonia, all demonstrate his ability to hang on a detail (Shooting an Elephant) while turning it into something intellectually profound (Down and Out in London and Paris). Now, the final reason for me backing Orwell in this horse race may be self-incriminating. It's not that I haven't read other English-language authors--it's that I haven't read enough. I've certainly read Shakespeare, Conrad, Dickens, Koestler, Bradbury, Woolf, Heller, Vonnegut, etc. But I haven't touched others whom some people may fervently believe to be the greatest to have ever lived (some people swear by their Asimov, or more recently Toni Morrison). As a result, this CMV is still a discussion of why you think I'm wrong, but it will likely also develop into a list of suggestions for what I (and anyone else) absolutely need to read in order to make such a bold assertion. One ground rule--like the title says, I'm limiting this to English language authors only. That means Kafka, Dostoevsky, and Marquez are all out of bounds, despite their brilliance. I do this for two reasons: to narrow the discussion to authors we can all talk about with more confidence, and to control for poor translations and native speakers of German arguing that Nietzsche was actually the unparalleled prose stylist in his language. TL;DR Orwell's the best English language author there ever was. He wrote in an aesthetically pleasing way, and his thoughts were sharp and societally useful. Feel free to mention authors that I may not have read, but make sure they wrote (write) in English and deserve the title of ""Best Ever.""

But I can\'t imagine finding him superior to Vonnegut when we look at the range of rhetoric, short story, and novel. But to some degree, it matters how much you\'ve read. \nThough honestly, I think the greatest English language authors are poets. I mean, Maya Angelou, Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Margaret Atwood (who also kills it with prose but it\'s her poetry and shorter stories that show the true craft), Carol Ann Duffy, Elizabeth Bishop, even some classics like Dylan Thomas, Sylvia Plath, Robert Frost (the path diverged poem doesn\'t do him justice), Coleridge, and Poe. There are so many poets who can do things with language Orwell wished he could do. \nAnd then my case for Vonnegut is structure. Orwell is extremely straightforward. I\'d actually argue his writing, while very good, is very political and journalistic. I wouldn\'t say it\'s one note because some of his lesser known works vary greatly in tone and purpose from 1984 etc. But he doesn\'t really ""play"" with structure or tropes as much as someone like Vonnegut. He also doesn\'t -- for all his intelligent fixation with the power of language -- play as effectively with language as many great poets. \nOrwell is a fantastic writer, but what he\'s actually best at is not writing but sensing the ills within society and presenting them via intelligent means. His writing was serviceable to good, with moments of brilliance, and made his messages resonate in some cases. But I think he died before he reached the top of his craft, especially in fiction. I think Orwell can give Vonnegut a run for his money in essays (of course in rhetoric, Vonnegut actually delivered a lot of his speeches to hilarious effect), though Vonnegut is funnier. But essays were Orwell\'s forte more than fiction. \nBut I\'d argue that skill in writing goes essays/rhetoric (a more common skill we theoretically want to teach every child), narrative fiction, then poetry. Orwell was best at less complex forms of writing and, in his heart, a journalist more than a fiction writer though he did both. He writes in Why I Write that he aspired to poetry as a youth but he is no poet. \n', ""Δ I like your approach here. Compartmentalizing the field into poetry, artistic prose, and more journalistic fiction seems a more manageable way of opening the discussion to subjectivity. When you mentioned Sylvia Plath, I immediately thought that she and Orwell cannot be compared with each other, but perhaps this is precisely the point. You're also right that Vonnegut's innovation should not count against him. This argument works for me--thanks for your comment!\n"", ""Thanks for the delta. Coincidentally, I'm an English teacher and one of my preps is currently just starting 1984 (we started Thurs!). \nMy favorite Orwell piece is Why I Write and we use that (I made an abridgement for students) later in the unit. I think Orwell articulates there the argument for writing as an important and noble profession better than anyone, for the record. \nThe kids I teach almost always like SH5 better universally than 1984 though. They usually like both -- I teach nerds for the record. (The 9th graders love Animal Farm though because allegory is so grounded in fact and that appeals to them. They find comfort in certainty. But it's not their favorite 9th grade book which is Of Mice and Men.) \nOh -- also read the speech Fates Worse Than Death by Vonnegut if you haven't. It's both haunting and hilarious. I think Vonnegut is better at humor than Orwell. \n"", 'Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/berrieh (23∆).\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n', 'I’ll offer Salinger as the greatest English language author of all time. I think that his work, while as firmly rooted in the context of his time as Orwell, will persist beyond any of the other authors mentioned here because the core of his work is about the human condition in a way the transcends particulars about  the modern Western world. He also did more with less than Orwell, Dickens, Hemingway. He didn’t need to  place his characters in a war, or in a dystopian future, etc to move the reader just as deeply.\n', ""That's true. Salinger did great work in The Catcher in the Rye, and the only reason why I didn't strongly consider him as a frontrunner is because he's as much of a one-hit wonder as any author of the 20th century. He wrote other short stories that were published in The New Yorker after '51, but I haven't dug through those yet. Catcher might be the best English-language psychoanalytical piece, on par with Crime and Punishment, if we were to include Dostoevsky here. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to prioritize the writers who showed excellence over several works, and this wasn't Salinger's strong point (unless, of course, you know his writing better and would argue that the rest of it is world-class as well).\n"", 'The rest of his work is excellent. He wrote four novellas, which fit in such a way that they were combined into novel length books (Franny & Zooey; Raise High the Roof Beam Carpenters & Seymour, an Introduction) Franny & Zooey rivals Catcher in the Rye as his best work. He also published short stories, as you mentioned. All of his non TCR work, except for 8 of the Nine Stories) is about the same fictional family. I would argue that The Catcher in the Rye is a more spiritual/humanist book that a psychoanalytic one, but maybe these are just different words describing the same ideas. What’s incredible about his work to me is that I can reread at different times in my life and see it completely different.\n', 'Disclaimer: I have only read Animal Farm and 1984\nHis thoughts were sometimes too on the nose and sometimes not clear enough for what his is intending as an author. That is why his works have a lot of debate and studying from year 6 (10/11 year olds) to university level. And that is a great thing as a student to study and debate work. But is he doing his intention as an author? Likely not.\nSo my proposal for greatest English language author is Kurt Vonnegut. Asthetically pleasing writing with good combination of cramming meaning in every word and delivering the point. At the time and even now, daring writing topic of his most famous work. The intention of the book is clear. We have a character with some form of PTSD due to the terrible occurings in WW2. We still have questionable and debatable scenes because he is unreliable. The book is written like a dream sequence and is very well written as one which takes a lot of talent to not sound just like a load of junk. He has quite a few memorable quotes throughout all his works and has a clear author voice through his works which Orwell has less of. \n', ""Hmm. I guess this is where the subjectivity comes in. SH5 is pretty great, but I read it as almost an antithesis to the kind of war literature that existed at the time. It's a response, a reaction to the style of writing that already existed--it's a stylistic protest, and a good one. Your point about taking skill to write a good dream sequence is spot on. But I disagree that Orwell lacks voice. I don't think he's detached from his characters and the way they speak. Perhaps books like 1984 gave you this impression (they gave me it too) since the setting is so dreary and vapid for a significant portion of the narrative. \nI think the twenty-or-so pages set in Room 101 are topical, symbolic, and understandable within the context of the novel. Scenes of raw emotion like those rarely lack voice, I think. \n"", 'Did you consider Joyce? Fitzgerald? Steinbeck?  Hemingway? \n', 'I suppose they fit into the ""etc."" that I offered at the end of the list of names. Let me offer my argument against each.\nJoyce is great, but terrifically difficult to read. One only really reaps maximum benefit while reading his books with an advanced literature class, or with a companion analysis volume. (This is my experience, and perhaps you\'ve learned to parse Joyce more fluidly than I have). \nFitzgerald is also great, and Gatsby might be the greatest book of all time, but to my knowledge the list of works that he wrote while at his peak is unfortunately short. If only his sample size were the size of the First Folio...\nSteinbeck is also appealing, but in my eyes too rigid and grounded in one time period and one location. I never found more than one general mood to his works while reading them. Besides, there\'s the little problem of fabrication when it comes to his travel book, ""Travels with Charley.""\nHemingway is the toughest to refute out of these four. The Old Man and the Sea is the kind of short novel I wish were written more often these days. I suppose I find his prose to be too consistently simple to have the kind of poetic bite that would match Orwell\'s. Just my opinion here. Let me know what you think.\n', ""\nFitzgerald is also great, and Gatsby might be the greatest book of all time, but to my knowledge the list of works that he wrote while at his peak is unfortunately short.\n\nI mean, Orwell has the same issue.\n1984 is great.  Animal farm is very good.   The rest?  OK level, certainly not better than the lesser known Fitzgerald's works.\n"", ""I'd likely disagree with that. I think Homage to Catalonia remains the greatest piece of war journalism in history, and Down and Out in London and Paris is Dickens-level analysis of urban youth and poverty in industrial Europe. Orwell also left behind hundreds of essays, and some say this was his forte--not full-length novels. I haven't read any of Fitzgerald's works besides Gatsby and Silent is the Night. If you think his other books are worth a read, I'll make sure to check them out.\n"", 'Dubliners is pretty easy to read.  Both An Encounter and Araby stuck with me a lot.  I read A Portrait of the Artist when I was 15 and understood it pretty well, and the opening chapters of Ulysses are some beautiful writing.  He definitely got up his own ass though.  \n', 'Check out how Orwell compares to Shakespeare on Google Trends and on Google ngram. \nIf Orwell was greater than Shakespeare, more people would read him, more writers would write books about him and translate him and make movies about his works, more English professors would offer classes on him. Orwell may speak to you personally more than Shakespeare does, but the world at large, and English writers and professors in particular, finds Shakespeare has more to say. I personally love Orwell, but he’s mostly interesting for his political allegory. Shakespeare’s work is much more universal in scope.\n', 'It\'s Shakespeare and it\'s not even close.  You even praise Orwell by calling him ""Shakespearean.""\nYour view focuses on fiction, and Shakespeare is best thought of as a poet.  But in terms of quality of writing, of word choice and syntax, no one approaches him.\nLook at this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q89MLuLSJgk\nI mean, the language is music.  But beyond that, look at the character being expressed.  Swaying between irony and genuine emotion (and it\'s never fully clear if the emotion is a manipulative act, too).  The moment is ambiguous and forceful at the same time, and I don\'t know any other writer who could do that.\n', 'Disclaimer: I have only read 1984, Animal Farm, Shooting an Elephant and Politics and the English language.  \nI disagree with this bit:  \n\nOrwell had a very particular affinity for predicting the future. I\'m not saying that any significant element of the world he created in 1984 came true, just that as a thinker he was more capable than any of his contemporaries of observing his political and economic surroundings, and turning them into a work of prose that remains relevant and intelligible decades later. \n\nI don\'t think his work holds up as much as people like to think.  I understand you\'re not saying Orwell was trying to predict the future.  He wasn\'t.  I get that.  But he wasn\'t trying to speak about the future at all.  He was speaking about the president.  1984 and Animal Farm were about events in the past...they were about Stalin\'s reign of power in the USSR.  Animal Farm is more or less a retelling of the anti-tsarist folks rebelling, taking over the USSR, Stalin gaining power and casting out Trotsky.  1984 is essentially a look at the USSR if it took place in the future, where there is more technology and a firmer control of the people, and in what ways the government can control us more.  Neither book is about capitalist democracy like the US or UK, and Orwell never was talking about how capitalist democracy could get worse.  He was talking about how socialism, his own economic philosophy, can be exploited to hurt the people, and how Stalin did just so.\nAnd Orwell is pretty dated in terms of his beliefs in knowledge.  I\'m not really a linguist myself but I think modern day linguistics is pretty skeptical about linguistic relativity, the idea that language shapes thought to a significant extent (like it does in 1984).  \nOrwell\'s works have a lot of relevance mostly because people yell out ""1984!!!, Big Brother!!!"" every chance they get, even when it doesn\'t make sense.  \n', ""I'm beyond happy to see the Vonnegut comments here, so I'll just add a bit. \nIf anyone can surpass Orwell within the logic youve used to establish him as the best, it's Vonnegut. His prose is very poetic and whimsical. Kurt writes in a simplistic, minimaist way. He tries to entertain and not far himself as seriously as Orwell. His storytelling is buried in layers of interpretative meaning, humor and all of his work is useful to society, if theyll only listen. God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater focuses on the humanistic, more social aspect of the same themes from 1984 and Animal House. This seems to be the most noticeable difference in their content matter: Vonnegut tried to hit home as opposed to awakening a nation, like Orwell. He wrote on a more down-to-earth level on these subjects, instead of outside the grand scheme of things, like Orwell, if that makes sense. \nPerhaps Vonnegut embraces more absurdism than Orwell. \nOf course, Slaughterhouse-Five is his most popular work, but it isn't for everyone. It's really good and goes into many of the same things Orwell wrote about.Beyond Slaughterhouse-Five, read Sirens of Titan. I believe it was his second novel and, in my opinion, his best.\nI second (or third or fourth) the notion that Vonnegut is markedly better than Orwell. I love both authors, but I get more out of Vonnegut's work.\n"", 'Orwell’s essays are amazing and thought-provoking, but I’m not sure his fiction books are on a par with his essays. Have you read Raymond Carver? He manages to say lots with the fewest words I’ve read from any author. The argument is to whether the minimalist style is his or his editors. I’ve read the non edited versions of his work and it’s nowhere near the level of when he’s working with Gordon Lish, his editor. \nI’m struggling to think of descriptions from Orwell that are especially interesting, whereas I think Carver along with writers like Salinger, Paul Auster and Ian McEwan have lots of great descriptions and characters whereas Orwell doesn’t really have great characters he’s basically good at creating a world that reflects society.\nI’d maybe say he is the best English language essayist rather than writer. If you have the chance check out Raymond Carver’s poems and short story collections (think the one I remember being best is “What we talk about when we talk about love” but it’s been a while since I read it so it might not be the exact title)\n', ""I doubt that anyone will be able to change your view...\nAs you noted it's highly subjective. \nNo question that, Orwell is a great author, but so were Shakespeare, Dickens, Twain, Faulkner, Hemingway, Austen and Woolf. ( among others...) \nThe fact that you probably knew who I was referring to even when I didn't use their first names, tells you something about how good they are.\nWho's best? That is completely a matter of personal taste.\n"", 'Going to be crazy unpopular but. . . I’ll take Stephen King.\nThe Green Mile, 11/22/63, Hearts in Atlantis, It, the body of work in short stories, etc.\nGranted his career started with some pulpish writing but has clearly written some classics, become the most iconic writer of post war amaerica, has been able to write almost every style.\nIf you get points for being prophetic - go read the running man (way better/darker than the movie) where it’s about a society living through mean spirited reality TV that ends with an attack on the state . . .

The average single person makes around $20,000 a year, whilst married couples make upwards of $50,000. 
Even at $7.50 an hour a full time employee makes $15,000 a year. ANYONE can get an FHA loan if they save up just 3.5% of the houses value which would be a measly $3,150-$8,750, and have decent credit. Houses ARE affordable!If you quit spending money on shit you don't need, keep your credit in good order, then you can have a house that only costs you about $500-$900 a month in mortgage payments for 10-30 years.
Your parents and grandparents didn't get their house in one year or even five. It took them awhile too! But wait! You also want to be able to have a car, smartphones, a social life ect, right? Then Improve your education, start your own business, or learn a special skill so you can earn more and have more. 
You're only worth what someone is willing to pay for you, and you're entitled to nothing.
This was the normal mentality up up until the last few decades. I worked my ass off and went from a lowly farm laborer making $6 an hour to a warehouse manager for Schwan's, and now make $23 an hour which comes with full health coverage (including dental and vision),  have two nice looking fully paid off used cars, a nice house that I'll own in 9 more years, and have almost $20,000 in savings. How did I do it? When I wasn't working my $6 an hour farm job, I was studying business and 
using the library's free WiFi to learn special skills that I knew would look good on a resume.
This included computer repair, website/software coding, heavy machinery operation, and anatomy/art.
I also got certified in CPR and basic medical aid by my local hospital clinic. 
I even took up a part time job as a paper delivery boy just to make an extra $300 a month to get me and my girlfriend by. It sucked only sleeping for 4 or 5 hours a night and living off ramen noodles, peanut butter sandwiches, and the food shelf, but eventually I managed to save up enough to buy my first used car for $1,200, and with that I could finally drive the 46 miles to another town to work at Schwans (huge ice cream company).I applied online and got hired within a few weeks to be a palletizer who just stacked boxes making $14 an hour. I was so thrilled by this!
I hated the job though. Many times I wanted to quit because it's -20F in the freezer where we worked, and stacking 20-40lb boxes for 9-12 hours a day was exhausting. My fingers went numb from the cold and every part of my body was sore.
But my first weeks pay was more than a months pay when I worked on the farm. I knew I couldn't quit!
But I also knew I could do more.I continued studying and working hard and managed to be promoted to warehouse assistant manager.
 And when the manager became plant supervisor two months ago, guess who became manager? Me! So no! Don't tell me us millennials can't afford houses. We can! I got here through hard work, not luck.

They have been indoctrinated to believe it is essential to doing well. This indoctrinating has transferred to the working world too. In this climate, a predatory industry for student loans has been created.\nThe problem is people are/were going to school, racking up tens of thousands of dollars when they are young and frankly ignorant of the true consequences and not given frank career advice about majors. Students and families are told how important a college education is but not about what prospects look like to repay that debt in any given field.\nSo, if you were a person sold on the college idea and went to school and did not study a 'lucrative' field, you very well could find yourself paying a bill equivalent to a mortgage before you even address your other needs. The frank reality is some college majors are pretty poor choices if you have to pay back thousands and thousands in debt. I am not just picking on the 'pottery' majors but also including the 'teaching' majors at expensive schools. How does a public school teacher making $32k/yr afford paying back $60k+ in student loans?\nThe point is, a lot of millennials got setup to have rough times before they were mature enough to understand the full implications.

Let\'s see where that gets us on a a $150,000 house. Average fixed rate interest is 4.38%, bringing the total cost of the house to $269,773 with a monthly payment of $749 on a 30 year mortgage. We are left with $651 per month after paying the mortgage. But you own property now, so you gotta pay property tax too. Property tax is $2,197 per year on average making that another $183 a month. Brings us down to $486 per month. We need heat, water, and electricity, though. The average cost of utilities per year is $2,060, or another $171 per month. Down to $315, but the good news is we have our house in order. \nBut now, we gotta eat. A modest grocery budget looks like $125 per person per month, so that brings us down to $190. But, we\'ve gotta get to work, so we need a car. If you have a perfect driving record and aren\'t a male, and only have liability, you can probably get away with a rate of $25 per month. So, that takes us down to $165 per month. Gas. I usually spend about twenty bucks a week. So now we\'re at $85. We\'ve got no cable, no internet, and no health insurance but we made it. \nHowever, I will argue that $85 a month is not enough wiggle room to say you can ""afford"" a house. In the 21\'st century, you need a phone of some kind. Work wants to contact you and if they can\'t you\'ll lose a job. Even if you get a crappy pre-paid phone, you\'re probably looking at a minimum of another $50 a month, so you\'re down to $35. Let\'s say you get sick and need antibiotics. Nope not enough money (you don\'t have health insurance, remember?). Oil change? Inspection renewal? Brake replacement? Flat tire? Any of these common things could be a catastrophic occurrence and destroy your finances, forcing you to rack up debt and plunge into bankruptcy. This is not an affordable lifestyle. In order for it to be affordable, you need the wiggle-room to account for unexpected tragedies. \nIf you\'re married, sure, but how many people are married by 24 these days? It\'s not a reasonable thing to expect of a millennial, and based on the numbers you provided, owning a house is not an affordable lifestyle, especially when you consider just how destitute you\'d be living.

Some people do not. \n\nIt sucked only sleeping for 4 or 5 hours a night and living off ramen noodles, peanut butter sandwiches, and the food shelf\n\nYou never developed any health issues that would make lack of sleep and malnutrition so damaging that you were unable to work. \n\nbut eventually I managed to save up enough to buy my first used car for $1,200\n\nYou found a great deal on a reliable vehicle and were able to also afford gas+insurance due to having two jobs. \n\nand with that I could finally drive the 46 miles to another town\n\nIt sounds like you started in a very small town. If this is the case, you grew up in an area where cost of living was significantly cheaper than in a city.\n\nI applied online and got hired within a few weeks to be a palletizer who just stacked boxes making $14 an hour. \n\nA better candidate did not apply for this job. \n\nMany times I wanted to quit because it\'s -20F in the freezer where we worked, and stacking 20-40lb boxes for 9-12 hours a day was exhausting.\n\nYou were physically fit and healthy enough to perform this job. \n\nI continued studying and working hard and managed to be promoted to warehouse assistant manager.\n\nNo one else was a better candidate for the promotion. I\'d just like to point out here that if you need a promotion to afford a house, well...not everyone can be promoted. There are always fewer higher-level jobs than lower-level jobs. So, some people are just going to lose out. \nIn addition, you were lucky enough that you never had expensive ongoing costs you had to pay for while moving up, and you were not homeless through no fault of your own. For example, I know someone that had to pay a huge monthly amount for his mother\'s cancer treatment, and I know someone else that was kicked out of their home at 15 for being gay. People like that don\'t really have the options you did. \nAnd one last thing: I actually bought a house for $90,000 several years ago. Do you know how I managed to get a house for that cheap? \nIt was almost completely destroyed to the point that it was actually illegal to live there in its current state. That was the only reason. I spent another $20,000 and nearly a year restoring it. The only reason I was able to do this was because I happened to have the right skills and connections to do it, and happened to be in the right place at the right time to actually purchase the property. 99.9% of people just don\'t have that option available. Without that option, I would absolutely still be renting. \n', 'Statistics show that real house costs have tripled over the past 50 years. Some areas are worse than others of course. \nWe can quibble over what affordable means, I could buy some high end sports car if I made enough sacrifices in every other area of my life. Poor people can buy expensive shoes as a status symbol. Do we say they\'re really affordable though? I think that\'s incorrect.\nA house can cost 10-15+ years of income for younger generations, compared to being able to afford one on more like 2-4 years of income which was the situation their parents were in. \nWhat people are talking about when they call housing unaffordable is the increasing difficulty of owning a home independently in the US, and perhaps particularly in cities. It\'s about whether or not the cost is reasonable with all other things considered, not whether it\'s technically possible to buy something. \nHow financially wise is the investment of buying a house now considering the impact such a purchase will have on their quality of life more broadly? Being able to live without micromanaging money and stressing over small costs is a big deal. Being able to live without massive debt hanging over you is as well. I understand entirely why many people are opting out of what looks increasingly like a dismal rat race instead of a decent life.\nSome people deal with micromanaging finances and a generally more bean-counting approach to life better than others, granted, but the situation with housing costs means they\'re an increasingly risky investment for people who are young and understandably not yet prepared to take such a risk and commit to paying off something that can take over a decade to acquire.

7,elucila7,"I don't hate studying. It's just that I shouldn't have taken it seriously in retrospect. Now that I'm out of school, I wonder if it's okay/ responsible to tell students to just perform well enough to pass- that they shouldn't make the extra effort if it causes them unnecessary stress and time that could be spent to enjoy themselves instead. unjust work hours: you are expected and pressured to study outside of school hours. School ran from 7-4pm. To compare, the average entry level job won't expect you to work after hours. Should the company compel you to do so, you are compensated via over time pay on top of the regular salary (at least that's how it should legally work). Student life is akin to slave labor- you study (work) above 8 hours, you don't get compensated, and the work gets harder after hours because there's no longer any teacher to guide you. Initiative is expected for no personally desirable reward. Unjust workload: even if I studied and took the lessons seriously during school hours (which I did), I would never be able to pass the exams without studying after school because the coverage is too much for school hours to be sufficient time to study. The first time I worked it also seemed like the workload was too much, but it was only a matter of time before I got my bearings and the work became smooth sailing from there. There was lots of lulls/downtime between work hours depending on the season which allowed me to enjoy the company of colleagues. Student life was never smooth sailing because as soon as the exam is done, they never repeat the same coverage for the next exam- meaning previous knowledge learned is now obsolete (for lots of subjects). This is a frustrating cycle of never being able to relax- a far cry from actual work, which allows you to relax while you keep working because you acclimate over time (and get paid). Strained/estranged relationships: I look back and think that the drama and stress that my mom caused me because I needed to study harder/more was unnecessary. She made me cry more times than I care to admit. There's so many people who value their relationships with their parents, sometimes I wonder what I missed out on because I don't love mine. Then I think to myself maybe it's best I don't wish for better parents anymore, maybe my upbringing would have been filled with drama and stress anyway regardless of which parent I got.

Now that I'm out of school, I wonder if it's okay/ responsible to tell students to just perform well enough to pass- that they shouldn't make the extra effort if it causes them unnecessary stress and time that could be spent to enjoy themselves instead. unjust work hours: you are expected and pressured to study outside of school hours. School ran from 7-4pm. To compare, the average entry level job won't expect you to work after hours. Should the company compel you to do so, you are compensated via over time pay on top of the regular salary (at least that's how it should legally work). Student life is akin to slave labor- you study (work) above 8 hours, you don't get compensated, and the work gets harder after hours because there's no longer any teacher to guide you. Initiative is expected for no personally desirable reward. Unjust workload: even if I studied and took the lessons seriously during school hours (which I did), I would never be able to pass the exams without studying after school because the coverage is too much for school hours to be sufficient time to study. The first time I worked it also seemed like the workload was too much, but it was only a matter of time before I got my bearings and the work became smooth sailing from there. There was lots of lulls/downtime between work hours depending on the season which allowed me to enjoy the company of colleagues. Student life was never smooth sailing because as soon as the exam is done, they never repeat the same coverage for the next exam- meaning previous knowledge learned is now obsolete (for lots of subjects). This is a frustrating cycle of never being able to relax- a far cry from actual work, which allows you to relax while you keep working because you acclimate over time (and get paid). Strained/estranged relationships: I look back and think that the drama and stress that my mom caused me because I needed to study harder/more was unnecessary. She made me cry more times than I care to admit. There's so many people who value their relationships with their parents, sometimes I wonder what I missed out on because I don't love mine. Then I think to myself maybe it's best I don't wish for better parents anymore, maybe my upbringing would have been filled with drama and stress anyway regardless of which parent I got. It hurts to think how much happier I could have been anyway. Can you detect Asian? Haha.

The same can be said for your negative situation - there may be some who could benefit from the knowledge that they don't have to be an academic powerhouse to have a good life, but for many, the advice could dissuade a descent level of effort that might be important to them.  Ultimately, though I think the people who need advice in all this are the parents.   \nI won't make a blanket statement that forcing some level of effort or results from your children is always bad, but for the most part children should be guided to pursue success, be resilient in the face of failure, and take their own life seriously.  Once they learn to do these things, how they go about it is really their choice.\nA culture that drives for academic success isn't inherently a negative, and kids that grow up in that culture shouldn't feel dissuaded from academic success merely because it is pushed hard.

9,WheresSmokey,"If we mandated rules for the house and the Senate via a constitutional amendment, we could end the so called nuclear option and force moderation when it comes to cabinet/judiciary picks. This would also allow for the systems of checks and balances to work a lot better by allowing congress to be a better check on the president so that he/she can't, with 51 allied senators, up end the entire federal government. Additionally, if we set the minimum votes for a bill to pass to 60% instead of 50% (60 votes in senate, and 261 votes in the house) we could force the parties to have to work together more since they would NEED members of the opposing party to vote for their bill.I know this wouldn't always work. But just to use the senate as an example, from what I can see, between 1970 and 2010 there were 20 congresses, only 3 times did one party hold 60 or more seats(under Ford, Carter, and Obama). This means that very rarely would a party ever be able to just sweep the govt however they want and rarely would a president with extreme tendencies be able to push his agenda through without it being watered down and moderated.I hold this view because I believe that a stable govt is a good govt. And with the two parties becoming more and more polarized every election cycle, swapping govt control between the two is going to give the country whiplash. However, forcing the two parties to have to work together more often (without a strong majority) would force the two ends to work together to make a country that better represents everyone.I do believe that forcing a multi party system would be more ideal, but since I don't see that going away anytime soon, would this be an a good way to polish the turd of a two party system?Note: I'm not super attached to this view, was just chatting with a friend and thought this might really be helpful and couldn't think of anything wrong with it per se.Edit: also, this would help strip some of the power from the president and help people focus more on their congressmen rather than the president as much because he would effectively be a manager rather than a total policy maker if he can line up his congress with a 51% majority","['DeltaBot', 'Huntingmoa', 'WheresSmokey', 'Huntingmoa', 'WheresSmokey', 'Huntingmoa', 'WheresSmokey', 'Huntingmoa', 'WheresSmokey', 'Huntingmoa', 'WheresSmokey', 'DeltaBot', 'in_cavediver', 'WheresSmokey', 'in_cavediver', 'WheresSmokey', 'DeltaBot', 'down42roads', 'WheresSmokey', 'ItsPandatory', 'SparkySywer', 'WheresSmokey', 'ItsPandatory', 'WheresSmokey', 'ItsPandatory', 'DeltaBot', 'ItsPandatory', 'WheresSmokey', 'WheresSmokey']","[""/u/WheresSmokey (OP) has awarded 3 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""Why would it force more bipartisanship and not more just more deadlock?

10,pizzahotdoglover,"I see this argument used on the left and the right, and I don’t think that it’s valid. For example:These arguments only seem to work because there are other independent justifications for legalization in each example: But for crimes that don’t have independent justifications for legalization, the argument that they should be legalized because they will happen anyway makes no sense. For example:The argument, ‘X will happen anyway so X should be legal’ is faulty because it can’t justify legalizing X unless you already agree that X should be legal. If X is something bad, then this argument makes no sense, because it endorses giving up on a problem, which will only make that problem worse. If X is not a problem, then it shouldn’t be illegal in the first place. Since the argument only applies if you already think that X should be legal for unrelated reasons, and since it has no persuasive value if you think X should be illegal, it isn’t a useful argument; it doesn’t add anything. If X is bad enough to be a crime, then it makes no sense to legalize it just because people are willing to commit that crime. If you’re okay with legalizing X just because people will do it no matter what, then X shouldn’t be illegal in the first place. If the test for whether a something should be legal were “are people willing to do it even if it’s illegal?” then every crime would be legal.So I suppose I will award a delta if you can provide an example where the ""people will do it anyway"" argument is dispositive; i.e., where people doing it anyway or not is the determining factor that makes the difference between whether something should be illegal or not.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

And usually the only reason it\'s counterproductive is that people will keep doing it anyway in large enough numbers to cause those problems.\nThis doesn\'t apply to outlawing something like murder, because as far as I know, there are no significant negative outcomes due to people ""doing it anyway"" (aside from the murder itself), largely because the numbers of ordinary people murdering people is tiny in the first place, and the black market for it is even tinier. \nIt\'s always a balancing act when you decide to outlaw something: does the gain (assuming there is any) outweigh the cost?\nIn cases where there is a market for something, enough people using the inevitable black market does have to be weighed against any benefit we might get from outlawing it. \nIgnoring that cost in the decision is just dumb.\n', '\nThe costs of prohibition are sufficient reason and a very good argument against making alcohol illegal (again)... If you could actually stop alcohol from being consumed, the social benefits would outweigh any black market, because the black market would not exist, by definition. The fact that you can\'t is incredibly relevant.\n\nSo you don\'t see any social benefits to alcohol, independent of the cost of prohibition? Even if you could guarantee 100% compliance and zero cost of enforcement, I doubt the VAST majority of people would still want to outlaw drinking, because, like weed, prostitution, guns, and abortions, there are independent reasons for keeping it legal- benefits it provides that make people value having the right to do it. My point is, it only makes sense to weigh the cost of prohibition if there’s already good reason to allow the activity. You wouldn\'t suggest legalizing human trafficking if the cost of enforcement were too high, would you? Even if something is costly to enforce, that isn’t a justification for making it legal- at best, it’s a pragmatic argument against enforcement, or an acknowledgement that enforcement would be impractical. \n\nHowever, those costs of prohibition only apply because of the fact that ""enough people are going to do it anyway""...

If society has decided that something isn\'t a problem, then that is the reason why it should be legalized- not because it will happen anyway. \nI\'ll also add that my OP isn\'t precisely opposing the argument that things should be legal when enforcement is counterproductive; it\'s opposing the argument that people are going to do the illegal thing regardless, so it should be legalized. So in the abortion example, the argument isn\'t that banning abortions would be counterproductive, either by being too expensive (it wouldn\'t cost much to prohibit doctors from performing the procedure), dramatically increasing organized crime (there wouldn\'t be a back-alley abortion mafia), or failing to reduce the total number of abortions (significant reduction would surely happen); the argument is that some people are going to get them no matter what, so they should be legal, and that is the argument I think is invalid, because it only applies to things where an independent reason exists to support them.\n', '\nif everyone is doing it, it must be something beneficial and acceptable, so independent arguments for legalization exist besides the cost of enforcement. If society has decided that something isn\'t a problem, then that is the reason why it should be legalized- not because it will happen anyway.\n\nAll arguments are a weighing of the balance of scales on the opposite sides. And people are well known for doing things that have net-negative social costs in spite of their own personal benefits. It\'s the basis of the entire Prisoner\'s Dilemma problem. \nSo sure, there might be good arguments in addition to this one that weigh against outlawing, such as benefits from the activity. \nBut the idea that the costs of enforcement shouldn\'t be considered at all is silly. It\'s just yet another reason not to outlaw something.\nIf the reasons against outweigh the reasons for, the thing shouldn\'t be outlawed. All you\'re doing by ruling out counting the costs of enforcement against a non-compliant populace is shifting the balance in favor of outlawing things. \nLet\'s say, for example, that the (mostly personal) ""benefits"" of alcohol were 10 on some arbitrary scale. And at the (mostly social) costs of alcohol were 12 on that same scale. \nThat would argue for outlawing it.\nHowever, if you add in the fact that the costs of the black market that would arise due to non-compliance are (from historical experience) 13 on that same scale (i.e. even larger than the other costs), now the balance would be:\nIn favor of outlawing: 12\nAgainst outlawing: 10+13=26\nThe fact that large numbers of people would continue with it in spite of outlawing shifts the balance of arguments dramatically. \n', ""\nSo sure, there might be good arguments in addition to this one that weigh against outlawing, such as benefits from the activity.\nBut the idea that the costs of enforcement shouldn't be considered at all is silly. It's just yet another reason not to outlaw something.\n\nΔ\nChange in my view:\nOnly in certain borderline cases where the decision to legalize is a close one because 1) no important moral precepts are involved and 2) independent reasons also weigh in favor of legalization, it can sometimes be appropriate to factor the cost of non-compliance into the decision of whether to outlaw something.\nBut the rest of the time, it's not something that should make a difference either way, because if an important moral precept is involved (like a stance against theft or child trafficking), then the cost of enforcement due to non-compliance shouldn't factor in, and if there are no independent reasons that would justify legalizing it, non-compliance and its associated costs alone won't justify it.\nI have yet to see a good example of something that should be illegal except the costs of non-compliance are too high, but I'll concede that I can imagine that hypothetical. Still, in every real world example I can think of, the argument for prohibition can be defeated even without considering these costs. \n"", 'Honestly, really, we did try banning alcohol, and it was a shit show.

The argument isn\'t really ""people are going to do X anyway, so let\'s legalize X,"" it\'s ""X is bad, but making X illegal doesn\'t prevent X and ALSO causes Y which is bad, therefore X being legal is a lesser evil than X being illegal."" \nLet\'s run through your examples:\n\nPeople are going to get their hands on guns anyway, so we shouldn’t restrict gun ownership. If we outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns.\n\nis really ""it\'s not good for criminals to have guns, but banning guns doesn\'t actually stop criminals from acquiring guns while also preventing law-abiding citizens who wouldn\'t commit crimes from having guns. Therefore, banning guns is worse than not banning them.""\n\nPeople are going to smoke weed anyway, so we should go ahead and legalize it. If weed is illegal, then people will get it off the black market, which supports cartels and introduces pot smokers to criminal elements in society.\n\nis really ""weed isn\'t good for you, but banning weed doesn\'t demonstrably affect how many people smoke while also [de-legitimizing the rule of law in the eyes of minorities who are disproportionately criminalized by these laws, creating a black market which props up cartels which commit violent crimes, etc.] and therefore legalizing weed is better than attempting to ban it, as banning weed causes more ills than simply allowing it does.\n\nPeople are going to get abortions anyway, so we should legalize them. If abortions are outlawed, women will just get back alley abortions performed in unsafe conditions. Abortions should be legalized so that women who would get them anyway can do so without risking their lives.\n\nis really ""a perfect world would have no abortions, but banning abortions doesn\'t have any demonstrable effect on the number of abortions performed in a country while also risking the lives of women who resort to performing back-alley abortions. Therefore, banning abortion is worse than allowing abortion because banning abortion doesn\'t actually achieve it\'s goal and causes more suffering than simply allowing it.\n\nProstitution will happen no matter what, so we should legalize it. If prostitution were legal we could tax it and regulate it.\n\nis really ""prostitution is bad, but banning prostitution has no effect on the numbers of prostitutes in a country while also [forcing the trade underground and risking the lives of the women working in sex work, promoting the spread of STIs in sex work, making it impossible for the government to mitigate the damages of sex work]. Therefore, prostitution should be legalized because making it illegal does nothing to prevent prostitution and makes the matter even worse for sex workers and society at large.\nIn your examples refuting this style of argument, the argument falls apart simply because you ignored the second condition of the argument: that the ban has to create an environment worse than before the ban. Specifically, you use examples with many positive effects brought on by a ban of X. Let\'s break it down:\n\nIf we outlaw arson, only outlaws will commit arson.\n\nThis ignores that banning arson has the tangible benefit of protecting people from arson, as those who commit arson will be held accountable (financially and criminally) for the destruction of life and property they cost. This ban has a demonstrable positive impact, not a demonstrable bad impact.\n\nPeople will hire hit men no matter what, so it should be legal. If murder-for-hire is illegal, people will just hire assassins on the black market, which supports cartels and introduces them to criminal elements of society.\n\nThis ignores that banning hit-men makes it easier for law enforcement to prevent hits before they happen by allowing law enforcement to find people attempting to hire hit men and charging them before real damage (like death) can occur. This also ignores that people who seek out hit men have already introduced themselves to the ""criminal"" elements of society in the sense that they are attempting to take another person\'s life, so ""forcing"" them to interact with criminals to hire hit men hasn\'t caused more harm than already exists before banning hit men. On the contrary, a ban in this case causes less harm, which is what renders the argument above moot: there is no ""Y condition"" which makes a ban worse than legalization.\n\nPeople will buy chemical weapons no matter what, so it should be legal. If buying chemical weapons is illegal, people will purchase them in unsafe conditions. Buying chemical weapons should be legalized so that people who will buy them anyway can do so without risking their lives.\n\nThis ignores that banning chemical weapons makes it easier to prevent terror attacks. Society is not worse off with a ban on chemical weapons, so this doesn\'t meet the ""Y condition"" of the real argument than society is worse off with the ban. You attempt to meet this condition with the qualifier ""so people can get chemical weapons without risking their lives,"" but most people would say that a terrorist having to risk their life to commit a terror attack is better than a terrorist not having to risk their life to commit a terror attack, so it\'s moot.\n\nKidnapping and holding people for ransom will happen anyway, so it should be legal. If we make it legal, we could tax it and regulate it.\n\nThis ignores, again, that the benefit of banning kidnapping and ransom is to protect people from being victimized. Banning kidnapping and ransom allows law enforcement to send these people to jail where they can\'t hurt more people. This is a demonstrable benefit to the ban, not a ""Y condition"" which makes a society with this ban worse off than a society where kidnapping and ransom is legal.\nIn short, you\'re misrepresenting the argument by ignoring the second half of it: the argument is not just that a ban is ineffective, but that this ban ends up causing additional harm to society making the ban quantitatively worse than legalization. When you take into account this ""Y condition"" the argument is much more effective.\n', 'This was very persuasive and I\'m going to go ahead and award you a delta for getting me to adjust my perspective of the argument I\'m challenging.\nΔ\nThat said, I did take this into account somewhat when I pointed out that in all the cases where the argument seemed successful, it was because there were independent reasons to support the act in question being legalized. So to go back through the examples, I don\'t think there\'s justification for outlawing them, even if perfect compliance were guaranteed: lawful gun ownership, smoking weed, prostitution, abortion- I don\'t think any of these are inherently wrong to begin with. \nSo I guess my original position was: whenever the ""people will do X anyway, so don\'t make X illegal"" argument seems to work, it\'s because X is actually positive and shouldn\'t be illegal in the first place. \nMy updated position is: [that same position] plus and in those situations, the prohibition of X (and people\'s non-compliance with that prohibition) causes additional harm (beyond merely preventing people from doing X) - the ""Y condition"" you described - that further justify legalizing X. In other words, the fact that people will do it anyway does have some evidentiary weight in support of legalizing X, in situations where X is something that should be legalized anyway for other reasons.\nHowever, I\'m still waiting for someone to provide an example of an act that should be illegal except for the fact that people will do it anyway. So a situation where the cons of X outweigh the pros of X to the an extent that justifies banning it, but people\'s non-compliance with an X ban nevertheless justifies keeping it legal (this might or might not include the Y condition you describe). Does that make sense? I know it got pretty abstract and algebraic.\nThe best example I could think of was heroin use: if people fully complied with a heroin ban, making it illegal would be sufficient. But they will do it anyway, so instead of banning it, we should offer treatment and not punish them.\nBut if we\'re ok letting heroin users off the hook (unlike how we feel about murderers) in order to deter heroin use, how can we justify putting them in jail at all, rather than just giving them treatment? This just puts us back into ""X should be legal in the first place"" territory.\nThe examples I\'m looking for all have to be things where it\'s only illegal in order to deter people from self harm or avoid the secondary effects, not because the act itself is inherently wrong, since in the later case, justice requires a punishment and wouldn\'t allow the calculation you talked about (e.g., you do not perform such a calculation when deciding whether slavery should be illegal- you oppose it on moral grounds; you wouldn\'t let a murderer off the hook even if you knew punishing him wouldn\'t deter anyone, because that\'s what justice requires). However, every example of stuff that\'s illegal because of these secondary effects, that could be solved another way, should be solved that other way- again putting us back into ""X should be legal in the first place"" territory.\n', 'Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/jerkyWrangling (1∆).\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n', 'I think that while “People are going to do it anyway” may not always (or even often) be a good argument for legalising anything, its valid when used as an indication that there is a majority of people who desire to do that thing.

I think the issue is that people aren\'t backing that up with the statements that should back that up. It\'s about what you can show really happens, and not what you can just speculate about.\nI think the success of the argument really varies depending on the issue. \nGuns is one where I think the argument that people will get guns anyway is kind of invalidated, because guns are a nonessential and largely undesirable thing (aside from protection (largely from other gun owners) and hunting (which is a nonessential, controllable activity and often disputed in desirability) , and are therefore only going to be accessed by criminals. The fact that only criminals may want to get a gun is an argument that causes some dispute, but in other places the argument is followed up with ""But because of that most of the time most criminals don\'t carry a gun around because they\'re not expecting to have to be prepared for escalation"". You can also demonstrably crack down on gun crime, too, and suicide rates are lower in a lot of countries where guns are not legal (although this can\'t entirely be blamed on guns). There may be a lot of arguments for guns, but the suggestion that people will just seek out guns doesn\'t play out. \nWhereas abortion is one where it probably is successful. It\'s suggested, for example, that rates of abortion do not go down where it\'s illegal and there is active harm in allowing women to undergo the dangerous procedure. Therefore there\'s a fair argument that regardless of desirability, it\'s better that it happens safely.

This creates and reinforces our shared cultural values, which are essential for a cohesive, functioning society.\nMaintaining rule of law: people refrain from taking matters into their own hands and enacting personal vengeance or vigilante justice because they are satisfied that when a person is proven guilty, the state will dispassionately administer justice in their stead.

They'll get them anyways, so at least if we make them legal they'll be healthier for the patients.\n\nLegalizing prostitution is also for the benefit if the prostitutes. Because it's illegal, but happens anyways, we should make it legal so prostitutes can safely report problems without legal issues.\n\nBasically, the point with these examples is that making it illegal does more than just make it illegal- it provides health and safety for the citizens who need it.\n"", 'I brought up all those examples to make the point that the argument only seems to apply to things that should be legal anyway. You could easily argue in of those examples that they should be legal, without bringing up that people will do it anyway, and there aren\'t any examples where ""people will do it anyway"" is the only reason to legalize something. You didn\'t address the counter examples of things that are obviously bad, where deterrence and compliance aren\'t even considered. Whether someone should get immunity from unrelated crimes when reporting a health and safety issue is a separate argument. \n', ""I didnt a dress the counter examples because this argument is only used in cases where the health and safety risks I mentioned exist.\nYou won't see anyone arguing in favor of arson being legalised just because 'people will do it anyways' because there is no risk anyone faces from not having access to the ability to commit arson. It's two different types of situations\n"", 'One difference between your examples is that in countries where abortion is illegal, it is more common, not less common, than in countries where abortion is legal (making abortion illegal disempowers women, which leads to power dynamics that result in more unwanted pregnancy). In all of your other examples, illegality actually does reduce the chance of the thing happening. \nCould you say that in cases where making something illegal actually makes it more likely, this argument makes sense? \n', 'Sure, but that\'s a different argument. ""People are going to do it more"" is different than ""people are going to do it anyway."" Plus, very often we make things illegal for reasons other than deterrence.\n', '\nSo I suppose I will award a delta if you can provide an example where the ""people will do it anyway"" argument is dispositive; i.e., where people doing it anyway or not is the determining factor that makes the difference between whether something should be illegal or not. \n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nLets take banning gun ownership then.  If nobody were to break the law regarding gun ownership, there would be no gun armed criminals, and you would likely have no benefit for armed populace.   Hunting, recreation, collectors etc - if they are willing to give up their weapons - that is, to not do it anyways - is a small price to avoid the massive toll gun violence causes.    That nobody will do it once the law is the law vastly reduces the cost of compliance and future enforcement, while still providing all the benefits on the \'pro\' side of banning gun ownership.\n\u200b\nWithout people \'doing it anyways,\' the benefits may very well outweigh the costs of enacting and attempting to enforce the law.\n\u200b\nThis is a contrived scenario, to be sure - as we can\'t guarantee a scenario where all would willingly just give up their guns, but it is illustrative of the costs society incurs when we expect non-compliance, and with some topics certain levels of expected popular compliance may indeed be the determining factor on putting a  law on the books, much like total compliance could be for the gun ban issue.\n', ""But these arguments only come into play when there are independent reasons to legalize something beyond the fact that some people won't comply. \n\nyou would likely have no benefit for armed populace. Hunting, recreation, collectors etc - if they are willing to give up their weapons - that is, to not do it anyways - is a small price to avoid the massive toll gun violence causes\n\nActually, there are plenty of reasons to keep guns legal even if we could guarantee 100% compliance with a ban. Law abiding folk still want to hunt, shoot, and defend themselves. These reasons won't go away if all guns were successfully banned. \n(Also, I don't think most gun owners would consider it a small price to pay. There are similar numbers of traffic fatalities as gun deaths in the US. Would you support a national speed limit of 25 mph, if you could guarantee 100% compliance? That would drastically reduce the number of traffic fatalities, but there are other reasons to oppose such a change. Gun owners feel the same way: the number of deaths is a price they're willing to pay for the benefits they perceive.)\n\nWithout people 'doing it anyways,' the benefits may very well outweigh the costs of enacting and attempting to enforce the law.\n\nIf a behavior is bad enough to outlaw, then it should be outlawed regardless of whether people insist on doing it anyway. If everyone chooses to do something even though it's illegal, that's probably a clue that there exists a separate reason for allowing it, and that separate reason is what you should rely on to allow it. \n"", 'When an activity is illegal but remains widespread, it leads to massive inequities in enforcement.\nYou used marijuana as one of the examples here.  People of all races and classes use marijuana, yet criminal enforcement of marijuana laws is disproportionately focused on minority communities.  The widespread use of marijuana among all communities reflects an evolving consensus that it isn\'t really a problem requiring drastic intervention, but because the laws remain on the books in many communities, and because people in poor and/or minority communities are far more likely to have interactions with cops, it means huge numbers of people in these groups wind up in various phases of the criminal justice system for an activity that wasn\'t at all unusual.\nWe can fix this inequity by recognizing that if ""everyone is doing it,"" we have made a collective decision as a society that it isn\'t something that should be illegal.\n', '1) I am not opposing the argument ""Everyone is doing it;"" I am opposing the argument, ""People are going to do it anyway."" Out of the 4 examples I gave, weed smoking is the only one to which your line of argument applies, since that\'s the only one where the activity would be so widespread. For example, the argument isn\'t, ""Everyone will get abortions anyway, so they should be legal;"" the argument is, ""Those women who are determined to get abortions will do so whether or not it\'s legal, so they should be legal."" It\'s a subtle distinction. \n2) If everyone is doing it, it must be something beneficial and acceptable, so independent arguments for legalization exist besides the cost of enforcement. If society has decided that something isn\'t a problem, then that is the reason why it should be legalized- not because it will happen anyway.\n3) Selective enforcement is bad, but it\'s a separate problem. If something is worth enforcing against one group, it\'s worth enforcing against all groups. If it\'s just used as an excuse to persecute disfavored groups, then it shouldn\'t be illegal in the first place.\n', ""Let's talk about prostitution. \nPeople do it anyways. The issue isn't just that though. It's that it being illegal means many victims of trafficking end up considered criminal themselves because of the ways our laws work in the US. They can't come to the police for help because the prolonged nature of trafficking means their actions aren't considered to be taken under duress, trapping them with their abusers. If they do get out, that record can follow them forever. This happens to people who are literally children. \nPeople do it anyways isn't wrong, it's just incomplete. The answer here for example is making solicitation a crime but not prostitution (therefore it's a crime for the customer only), or legalizing it so it can be regulated. Many people will say that countries with legalized prostitution have more trafficking victims-this is misleading, more victims come forward because they won't be prosecuted.\nBut let's apply that to something more controversial. Gun control. I won't say everyone is using it this way. But the issue is when I hear people talk about gun control...they often have no idea of what regulations there already are, or any ideas of what exactly they mean by more control. If you're for something, you need an answer to people will do it anyways. Like gun control, right now as it is we don't have effective means for tracking gun ownership. With more strict background checks for example, not only do criminals still have them, but we don't fix the large issues of people getting guns from dead relatives, friends, estate sales, or of children/teens using their parents legally owned guns. So...instead of reject people will still do it anyways, rise to it. Keeping track of where guns are and making people account for their guns annually, making everyone in a household go through a background check or a class, etc.\n"", ""Government is also about management.  Stalin wanted rivers to flow in the opposite direction, but you can't just do that.  You can manage rivers but you can't govern them like that.  Similarly, government should be a give-and-take.  We need to realize what people are going to do and we need to deal with reality.  People are going to do opioid drugs and abuse them, but instead of spending money on a war we know doesn't work, we should at least manage it so people can both get treatment and we can lower the cost of dealing with it.  Otherwise you'll have to explain why we should pursue policies that are expense and even exacerbate the policy, instead of policies that reduce the cost and reduce the instances.\nAnd to note, legalizing something doesn't always mean the same thing.  There's still the concept of decriminalizing something too.\n"", 'The basis for any legitimate government is consent. The rulers must have the consent of the ruled. \nIf the rulers make a law and the people simply ignore the law, then the government has lost the consent of the people in so far as that law is concerned. So you shouldn’t make a law that people will just ignore. \nOf course in reality things are less clear. There will always be some people who reject certain laws and there will be people who accept laws that will seem bad in retrospect. \nEven prohibition was successful in stopping many people from drinking as most people followed the law. But many people broke the law. The “people are going to do it anyway” argument points to the fact that having people breaking the law creates more bad effects than if the original action (however damaging) was simply allowed to continue. \n', '\nThe “people are going to do it anyway” argument points to the fact that having people breaking the law creates more bad effects than if the original action (however damaging) was simply allowed to continue.\n\nThis is a good way of putting it. But my position is that when this is the case, the original action should be legal anyway for independent reasons, even if making it illegal would ensure that it stopped, because if it causes less harm than a hypothetical prohibition would, and people generally like doing for some reason(s), and if you have no other moral qualms about legalizing it based on a calculus like that (the way you would about something that is inherently really morally offensive), then you don\'t have enough reason to ban it in the first place, so the addition of ""people will do it anyway"" adds nothing to your argument.\n', '\nBut my position is that when this is the case, the original action should be legal anyway for independent reasons, even if making it illegal would ensure that it stopped, because if it causes less harm than a hypothetical prohibition would, and people generally like doing for some reason(s), and if you have no other moral qualms about legalizing it based on a calculus like that (the way you would about something that is inherently really morally offensive), then you don\'t have enough reason to ban it in the first place, so the addition of ""people will do it anyway"" adds nothing to your argument.\n\nDo you realize that this is all one sentence?\nIt’s unreadable. \n', 'Lol, sorry, it\'s late and that was stream of consciousness and the omission of a key word in there didn\'t help. \nTake two: when the original action is so harmless that prohibition is more harmful than legalization, the original action should be legal even if prohibition could stop it 100%. In other words, if it\'s the kind of action you\'d consider legalizing in those circumstances, it should probably just be legal in the first place. \nAdditionally, if people would do it even if it were outlawed, there must be some benefit to it as well, that could also justify legalizing it. \nNow, there are some acts that are so morally offensive, you would never legalize them, even if prohibition didn\'t deter anyone (for example, you wouldn\'t legalize murder if you found out that keeping it illegal didn\'t stop anyone from murdering). But if legalization is on the table, then the action in question is not one of those inherently heinous acts- another point in favor of just making it legal in the first place.\nTo bring it back down from the abstract, all of the examples in my OP should be legal whether or not people would comply with their prohibition. So even if banning weed meant all weed smoking stopped, that still wouldn\'t justify banning weed. Even if outlawing abortions meant no abortions would ever happen, abortions should still be legal. So the point is, for any action where the ""people will do it anyway"" argument applies, there is already sufficient justification to legalize that action.\nHope that made more sense.\n', '\nAdditionally, if people would do it even if it were outlawed, there must be some benefit to it as well, that could also justify legalizing it.\n\nPeople are often self destructive and do things that don’t bring benefits. \n', 'Laws are not meant to be concrete. They are not meant to be a measure of morality or what is right and wrong. They are fluid and are meant to change with the progression of society. When the majority of society feels that something is now acceptable and it causes no harm to or from a person, then it should be legalized. \nBut those other crimes are violent in nature. They hurt other people maliciously and therefore are not able to be applied in that arguement because they cause major harm. One of the major pillars of things these should be doing is protecting citizens. And that includes our right to be safe. \n', 'If you doing something doesn’t infringe on someone else’s rights (owing a gun, doing drugs, ect.) there isn’t really reason for nit to be illegal now things like arson (destroying someone else’s property/life) murder/hiring ahoy man (killing someone/conspiracy to kill someone) does so basically as a contenting adult I should be able to do whatever I want to MYSELF as long as I’m not hurting anyone else.\n', '1: if you make something illegal and people still want to do it, the set of behavior around it will change. If one of the costs of banning something is that an underground market for it forms that enriches drug cartels or human traffickers, that is a real cost. Legalizing that thing then adds accountability to an already-existent market. You can’t eliminate the market or the behaviors associated with it, but you can reduce the chance that people get shot over it, or you can reduce the chance that people engage in risky behavior (sharing needles, for instance) by bringing it into the daylight. In other words, if legality does not effect use, it may nonetheless effect safety of use.\n2: in the case of guns (or, say, nuclear weapons), you have two sets of people, those who would follow the anti-gun law and those who don’t. If you make guns illegal, the set who would follow the law would not have guns and the set who would not follow the law would still have guns. If the latter set is also the one who does all the shootings and armed robberies, you might want other people to have guns for self defense against the lawless set. By making them illegal you give criminals a tool that law abiding people no longer have to defend themselves, when the whole purpose of banning the guns in the first place was to take them away from people who commit crimes with them. Those people who commit crimes will be unaffected by the ban, while the people who they might then terrorize would now also be unarmed. Similarly, it’s better that nobody have nukes, but if Iran and North Korea are the only ones that have them we’d be in a pretty bad situation. In other words, legality may only prevent ""legitimate use"" and leave ""illegitimate use"" unaffected or, worse, more harmful.\n3: we make laws to reflect what we want our society to look like and to maintain order in line with our values. If lots of people want a thing, it’s worth a second look at why it’s illegal in the first place. If you banned breathing, we’d all be felons because we care about living more than we care about the law. In other words, people wanting to do something is not value-neutral, and the fact that people want to do it enough to break the law is one of many factors we should consider in our policies.\n', 'What if X=anger?\nAnger is bad. \nAccording to your logic we should make anger illegal. \nDo you think that would be a good idea?\n', 'That\'s not my position.

And usually the only reason it\'s counterproductive is that people will keep doing it anyway in large enough numbers to cause those problems.\nThis doesn\'t apply to outlawing something like murder, because as far as I know, there are no significant negative outcomes due to people ""doing it anyway"" (aside from the murder itself), largely because the numbers of ordinary people murdering people is tiny in the first place, and the black market for it is even tinier. \nIt\'s always a balancing act when you decide to outlaw something: does the gain (assuming there is any) outweigh the cost?\nIn cases where there is a market for something, enough people using the inevitable black market does have to be weighed against any benefit we might get from outlawing it. \nIgnoring that cost in the decision is just dumb.\n', 'Firstly, I think you slightly misunderstand the argument of ""people are going to do X anyway, so let\'s legalize X."" The argument isn\'t really ""people are going to do X anyway, so let\'s legalize X,"" it\'s ""X is bad, but making X illegal doesn\'t prevent X and ALSO causes Y which is bad, therefore X being legal is a lesser evil than X being illegal."" \nLet\'s run through your examples:\n\nPeople are going to get their hands on guns anyway, so we shouldn’t restrict gun ownership. If we outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns.\n\nis really ""it\'s not good for criminals to have guns, but banning guns doesn\'t actually stop criminals from acquiring guns while also preventing law-abiding citizens who wouldn\'t commit crimes from having guns. Therefore, banning guns is worse than not banning them.""\n\nPeople are going to smoke weed anyway, so we should go ahead and legalize it. If weed is illegal, then people will get it off the black market, which supports cartels and introduces pot smokers to criminal elements in society.\n\nis really ""weed isn\'t good for you, but banning weed doesn\'t demonstrably affect how many people smoke while also [de-legitimizing the rule of law in the eyes of minorities who are disproportionately criminalized by these laws, creating a black market which props up cartels which commit violent crimes, etc.] and therefore legalizing weed is better than attempting to ban it, as banning weed causes more ills than simply allowing it does.\n\nPeople are going to get abortions anyway, so we should legalize them. If abortions are outlawed, women will just get back alley abortions performed in unsafe conditions. Abortions should be legalized so that women who would get them anyway can do so without risking their lives.\n\nis really ""a perfect world would have no abortions, but banning abortions doesn\'t have any demonstrable effect on the number of abortions performed in a country while also risking the lives of women who resort to performing back-alley abortions. Therefore, banning abortion is worse than allowing abortion because banning abortion doesn\'t actually achieve it\'s goal and causes more suffering than simply allowing it.\n\nProstitution will happen no matter what, so we should legalize it. If prostitution were legal we could tax it and regulate it.\n\nis really ""prostitution is bad, but banning prostitution has no effect on the numbers of prostitutes in a country while also [forcing the trade underground and risking the lives of the women working in sex work, promoting the spread of STIs in sex work, making it impossible for the government to mitigate the damages of sex work]. Therefore, prostitution should be legalized because making it illegal does nothing to prevent prostitution and makes the matter even worse for sex workers and society at large.\nIn your examples refuting this style of argument, the argument falls apart simply because you ignored the second condition of the argument: that the ban has to create an environment worse than before the ban. Specifically, you use examples with many positive effects brought on by a ban of X. Let\'s break it down:\n\nIf we outlaw arson, only outlaws will commit arson.\n\nThis ignores that banning arson has the tangible benefit of protecting people from arson, as those who commit arson will be held accountable (financially and criminally) for the destruction of life and property they cost. This ban has a demonstrable positive impact, not a demonstrable bad impact.\n\nPeople will hire hit men no matter what, so it should be legal. If murder-for-hire is illegal, people will just hire assassins on the black market, which supports cartels and introduces them to criminal elements of society.\n\nThis ignores that banning hit-men makes it easier for law enforcement to prevent hits before they happen by allowing law enforcement to find people attempting to hire hit men and charging them before real damage (like death) can occur. This also ignores that people who seek out hit men have already introduced themselves to the ""criminal"" elements of society in the sense that they are attempting to take another person\'s life, so ""forcing"" them to interact with criminals to hire hit men hasn\'t caused more harm than already exists before banning hit men. On the contrary, a ban in this case causes less harm, which is what renders the argument above moot: there is no ""Y condition"" which makes a ban worse than legalization.\n\nPeople will buy chemical weapons no matter what, so it should be legal. If buying chemical weapons is illegal, people will purchase them in unsafe conditions. Buying chemical weapons should be legalized so that people who will buy them anyway can do so without risking their lives.\n\nThis ignores that banning chemical weapons makes it easier to prevent terror attacks. Society is not worse off with a ban on chemical weapons, so this doesn\'t meet the ""Y condition"" of the real argument than society is worse off with the ban. You attempt to meet this condition with the qualifier ""so people can get chemical weapons without risking their lives,"" but most people would say that a terrorist having to risk their life to commit a terror attack is better than a terrorist not having to risk their life to commit a terror attack, so it\'s moot.\n\nKidnapping and holding people for ransom will happen anyway, so it should be legal. If we make it legal, we could tax it and regulate it.\n\nThis ignores, again, that the benefit of banning kidnapping and ransom is to protect people from being victimized. Banning kidnapping and ransom allows law enforcement to send these people to jail where they can\'t hurt more people. This is a demonstrable benefit to the ban, not a ""Y condition"" which makes a society with this ban worse off than a society where kidnapping and ransom is legal.\nIn short, you\'re misrepresenting the argument by ignoring the second half of it: the argument is not just that a ban is ineffective, but that this ban ends up causing additional harm to society making the ban quantitatively worse than legalization. When you take into account this ""Y condition"" the argument is much more effective.\n']",69.41,"[[68.26, 56.55, 57.3, 49.96, 32.87, 60.95, 48.17, 62.38, 74.35, 71.34, 59.64, 55.07, 48.17, 74.35, 43.9, 64.2, 73.47, 69.11, 63.53, 47.93, 0.08, 40.69, 78.48, 51.86, 70.33, 70.63, 51.62, 73.92, 70.47, 44.75, 50.36, 100.24, 96.52, 44.68, 61.26, 45.59, 57.91, 36.63, 68.06, 49.18, 58.82, 24.11, 58.42, 63.29, 63.49, 71.75, 29.9, 21.07, 55.78, 60.65, 74.08, 45.93, 61.9, 99.23, 92.12, 81.29, 71.1, 90.8, 71.85, 115.13, 119.19, 45.76, 86.71], [68.26, 56.55, 57.3, 49.96, 32.87, 60.95, 48.17, 62.38, 74.35, 71.34, 59.64, 55.07, 48.17, 74.35, 43.9, 64.2, 73.47, 69.11, 63.53, 47.93, 0.08, 40.69, 78.48, 51.86, 70.33, 70.63, 51.62, 73.92, 70.47, 44.75, 50.36, 100.24, 96.52, 44.68, 61.26, 45.59, 57.91, 36.63, 68.06, 49.18, 58.82, 24.11, 58.42, 63.29, 63.49, 71.75, 29.9, 21.07, 55.78, 60.65, 74.08, 45.93, 61.9, 99.23, 92.12, 81.29, 71.1, 90.8, 71.85, 115.13, 119.19, 45.76, 86.71]]"
11,Admira1Jackbar,"There are two components to my argument. First, I believe that releasing the results, in the manner that she did, will strategically/politically hurt her chances in 2020.Second, I believe the way in which she has sold her Native American ancestry is morally wrong.How should Warren have proceeded? I believe that she could have publicized her results without coming off as offensive and culturally incompetent. She could have used the video to honestly explain that her family had hyperbolized her Native American roots, that she does not identify as Native American, and that she has not been oppressed in any way because of her ancestry. This has been a rambling post, but I think ya'll get my major points.​Edit#1: Thank you so much all for engaging in this conversation. I have tried to respond to as many posts as I can but unfortunately have to get back to studying. My perspective is largely unchanged but I will continue trying to respond when I can. Furthermore, there has been some misinformation about the DNA test results and how they are interpreted. One user linked me this article, which has a great breakdown of what the test means. In summary, it is much more likely that Warren is 1/64th native American as opposed to 1/500th or 1/1,000 Native American. This doesn't really change my main points, but it is good to get the facts straight.​Edit#2: This boston globe article has a good summary of the situation at hand. A lot of people are saying that she has never identified as Native American, but that is contradictory to this relevant passage: ""In an interview with the Globe published last month, Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many of the matriarchs of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories and history were becoming lost. Ivy League universities, like the ones where Warren taught, were under great pressure to show they had diverse staffs.The University of Pennsylvania filled out a document explaining why it hired a white woman over minority candidates — clear evidence it didn’t view her as a Native American addition. And the Globe interviewed 31 Harvard Law School faculty members who voted on her appointment there, and all said her heritage was not a factor.""So, while I don't think it's likely that her career has been significantly furthered by claims to Native American heritage, the fact is that she has identified as Native American historically. I believe that she should have addressed this in her video and been explicit that it was a mistake to ever identify as Native American. Also, before you comment, I would strongly recommend reading the two articles I have linked as they provide most of the information you need to know.

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\'t generally go down well in MA. \nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\'s consider that she\'s got no 2020 plans.\nIf her seat is safe and she\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\'re beating on ""Pocahontas"" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MO), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \nSo Warren\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \nThat\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway. It makes more sense if she doesn\'t plan on running. \n', ""Hmm. Interesting take. I guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing.

If she can distract enough GOP hate to somehow help the Democrats win all of their competitive races and get back a Senate majority, she would have played a part in making sure that no more Kavanaughs happen between now and 2020. \nIf you see that as a good thing (as she surely does), then you could argue that she's doing a morally questionable action for the sake of a larger moral victory. In the end, the extent of damage she does here is frustrating a percentage of the Native American community for a few months. If the strategy works and the Dems take the Senate, there's the potential to prevent things that are way more damaging than that. So you could argue that going for the strategy would be a moral good. . . in aggregate (if not in isolation). \n"", ""Sure - I hereby award one !delta for giving me a new perspective. If it is the case that she is not going through with a 2020 bid, I believe that this might help other democrats in their respective campaigns by eating up news realestate that would otherwise be focused on them. Since Warren's seat is probably safe, the negative attention on her doesn't really matter for her personal political strategy. However, I don't believe that this was her strategy intentionally, rather, I believe this might be one positive consequence of an overall poor decision. I think it's more likely that Warren went through with this whole thing to advance her personal agenda rather than as some altruistic distraction. Furthermore, you mentioned the ND race - I think that's where this whole thing might be the most detrimental. If Native Americans votes are swayed by this whole thing or their enthusiasm is at all reduced, it hurts Heitkamp's chances.\n"", 'I think the main strategic advantage of Warren’s decision is that it disarms one of Trump’s primary avenues of attack, name calling.

Either possibility is beneficial. \n', ""Hmm.. I don't think Trump will stop using Pocahantas.

If a Dem starts arguing that she can’t be Indian because she doesn’t have enough ‘blood’, the identity politics wing of the party will cannibalize them.\nDefeating Trump is a matter of a lot of factors out of her control and more about how the Dems vs Reps mobilize and how current events and news sway voters.

But it\'s still extreme nationalism on racial grounds and that sounds a bit fascist to me.\nTBH I think Warren overplayed her hand a little, and she should have just snuck it out like Obama did his birth certificate. And not consulting with Native American tribes and thinking about how they might feel about this is really stupid. But I was horrified by the statement the Cherokee Nation put out.

Race theory would certainly suggest that, but these DNA tests only look for a handful of markers. \nThe problem with those tests is that one can be entirely native by heredity and actually not have those particular genes, and those genes can pop up in unrelated people. That\'s one of the big reasons why they don\'t consider them valid for tribal membership; they cannot measure ""how much"" you are of anything but human (and even then, we have a whole lot of DNA in common with other species). \n', ""\nThe problem with those tests is that one can be entirely native by heredity and actually not have those particular genes\n\nThey usually aren't looking at entire/functional genes in these tests, they are looking at % polymorphism match (single base pair) or they are looking at non-coding strands that have expanded over time.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a pretty minor issue.

Her colleagues and superiors say they knew her as a white woman. She never tried to obtain tribal citizenship or identify with any tribal nation in a legal sense.\nShe claims she did it in hopes that she might connect with other people of Native American descent, since she knew it was part of her family history and wanted to learn more. You can believe her or not, but again there's nothing to suggest she used this to advance her career.\nAs someone with experience in genetic genealogy, I would say her DNA results do in fact validate her Native American heritage. The report shows she very likely had a Native American ancestor 6-10 generations back. You might be thinking that's pretty far removed, but hear me out.\nWhen this whole thing popped up during Warren's senate campaign, she talked about how her family always told her they were part Native American. Genealogists started digging and discovered that Warren's great great great grandmother was allegedly Native American (her name was O.C. Sarah Smith). There was no solid proof, but it seems to be a common claim passed down among this woman's descendants. If this ancestor was full blooded, that would make Warren 1/32nd Native American. However, genealogists seem to agree that she wasn't full blooded. If this ancestor was half Native American, that would make Warren 1/64th Native American, which would mean Warren is 6 generations removed from a full blooded Native American ancestor. This fits with the DNA test, so it's totally plausible this ancestor (Warren's 3x great grandmother) was half Native American.\nA great great great grandmother is not as far removed as you might think. One of my great great grandmothers was still alive when I was born - I even have a picture of her holding me as a baby! I know all about this side of the family, because she lived so long. This is only one generation less than Warren's supposed Native American ancestor, so it's not unrealistic at all that the family might still be well aware of their heritage, and consider it to be a significant part of their identity. There would be physical traits, stories passed down, names... all of it eventually dwindling away generation by generation, but they still held onto the identity. If they openly shared this fact, it's not hard to imagine some unfavorable opinions when Warren's parents married in 1932.\nJust like many Native Americans who assimilated into European-American society, Warren's ancestors left no paper trail. If they didn't want to to be persecuted or discriminated against, they would do anything they could to fit in without a trace. It wasn't until relatively recently that it became acceptable or desirable to claim Native American ancestry. There are tons of families just like Warren's, who don't have it documented, but know through oral tradition. You can put all kinds of political spin on it, but it's hard to deny there's something amazing about DNA backing up oral family history from at least 6 generations ago, and that's the main thing I take away from this whole issue.\nIt's true that Warren is mostly of European descent, but at no point did Warren lie about this. Nothing she said has been proven wrong or even misleading... if anything, it's all been reinforced by DNA evidence.\nOn the other hand, strategically I would agree with you. Republicans don't care about facts or science. They will build their own narrative, and Warren is just fanning the flames by responding at all. Democrats aren't going to win by arguing with idiots. They win by talking passionately about important issues, and presenting a better vision for the future.\n"", ""Yup, I've come around to the conclusion that Warren hasn't benefited from or exaggerated her claims of Native American ancestry.

If she didn't take the test, then the questions would follow her and the RW media would focus on that exclusively, painting her as a lying cultural appropriator (what a leftist thing for them to say). If she waited till then to take the test, all the negative response you're seeing would be happening much closer to the election, which would lose her votes. \nTaking the test now gives her a solid rebuttal to those who claim she's lying, and it gets the inevitable negative press out of the way long before it could hurt her chances.

She should have humbled herself to the situation and said “look, it was a mistake to identify as NA given that my ancestor 6 generations back and I’m not invested in Native American culture. My family may have embellished the claims to NA identity as many families do, but there was truth to their stories and I’m glad to know the reality of my family history.

So, from a genetic standpoint, it's more accurate to say she is 1/64th Native American rather than 1/1024th.

These negative stories from the left would have never existed had she just remained silent and not played ball. In fact, I had never seen a negative story about Warren from mainstream news sources until the past few days. \n\u200b\n"", 'Do you not believe that Native Americans are oppressed?

This is almost three times the poverty rate of White Americans. \n', ""No one has oppressed them in a long time, they are a product of their own culture as is every other race. To blame inequality on racism is just ignoring that there are massive problems in the semi segregated communities that native Americans construct. No one except fringe lunatics goes out of their house in the morning looking to disadvantage people that aren't of the same race. \n"", ""You seem to have a pretty narrow view of what 'oppression' is. Just because no one is directly harming you doesn't mean you aren't oppressed. Blaming poor people for being poor because of their 'culture' is a racist argument and ignores the complex socioeconomic factors that contribute to and perpetuate poverty. \n"", 'I think that some of the scenes might have been catered towards a rural population, like her sitting on the porch with her siblings enjoying peace \nI might add that the Cherokee tribe does not accept anyone who’s not a direct descendant of a person on the Dawes Roll, none of Miss Warren’s ancestors have turned up on the roll, so she cannot claim citizen status (also her being 1/1024 is probably a flaw on the DNA’s testing, they are not accurate at determining Native heritage, and the category belongs to natives throughout the two continents of South and North America with no clear distinction. \nShe’s not losing the vote because of this, she’s very popular among the political left. \n', 'Just because she probably won’t lose the vote doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt her or Democrats in general. She could have handled the whole situation better in a myriad of ways, which is the gist of my argument. \n', ""There's no way to prove this now, but she's playing the long game. By the time 2020 rolls around, no one will really remember the cultural upheaval this reveal caused. They'll only remember that her DNA test showed that she has a Native American ancestor somewhere in her bloodline. By getting in front of these racist attacks, the only thing left for her opponents to smear her with while she campaigns is her record as a senator. If anyone tries to jeeringly call her Pocahontas two years from now, it will stink of ignorance and desperation. People forget details. That's how many a politician holds power.\nAlso this.\n"", 'Sure, but that doesn’t refute my point. That’s a relative argument. \n', 'I think you\'re assuming that there\'s the nothing option, the test option, and then another better option?\nI don\'t think that doing nothing is a good choice. Lots of democrats have tried to rise above the petty bickering, even some more moderate republicans in the last presidential primary tried. Where did it get them? No where, they lost because to some decent percentage of American voters any claim needs to be answered. Any unanswered claim seems like an admission of guilt. Are those voters uninformed idiots? Maybe, but the strategy of ""just make up bullshit and force the other person to refute it"" seems to have been working for the last couple election cycles (at least). So ""nothing"" isn\'t an option.\nTaking a test and proving that there\'s truth to her story at least takes the idea that she\'s just lying off the table. That\'s essentially been the claim coming from the right, and her counter claim, as far as I can tell has been:\n\nMy family always said that there was native american ancestory on my mother\'s side\nIt was such an issue that she said back in 2012 her father\'s family wasn\'t going to let him marry her mom, and they had to elope. And apparently it continued to be an issue her entire life because it also caused some problem at her mother\'s funeral. \nShe never claimed to be part of a tribe or ever claimed any kind of cultural heritage\nShe really hasn\'t mentioned it much at all in her entire career, and the only reason it\'s an issue at all is that republicans went looking for dirt from her past, and this is the best that they could come up.\n\nSo, I\'m not sure what a better option would be? Let the other party continue to mock her, call her a lie, make up shit about her without responding at all? Try to give a civil answer? Because that\'s what she was doing for the last 4 years.\nWhat\'s a better option than just definitively settling the truth, she\'s has a tiny bit of native american ancestry, which is basically what she\'s been saying the whole time. If someone wants to go put in the effort to disprove her claim that her parents eloped, then that would be real news. Because otherwise I can\'t see how she\'s done anything even remotely wrong.\n', ""I don't think the 'nothing' option would have been all that bad and I actually think it would have been better than what she ended up doing. By doing nothing, the issue would have gotten, overall, less attention in independent and liberal circles and would have remained more isolated in Republican circles. However, I think 'nothing' was a second best option. What would be a better option? She could have come right out and acknowledged that the extent of her Native American ties was overplayed in family lore. She could have consulted with tribal leaders and people more knowledgable in this topic in order to publish her results in a way that didn't feel so tone deaf. While she never says she belongs to a tribe, she does say she has Native American heritage. While this is true, it feels very uncomfortable to make that claim without a large asterisk every time noting that it is a very distant heritage. She has also checked boxes (one box?) in her college applications identifying as Native American - she should have acknowledged that this was wrong and then emphasized that at no other time past that point in her professional career did she capitalize on this identity (which she did in her video, but without acknowledging that she had identified as Native American when she shouldn't have). \n"", ""How can you possibly think that her apologizing for literally nothing is better than releasing the tests? There are two obvious benefits to releasing the test: \n1) there was a slim chance that the president kept his word and gave money to charity. That would have been a net win for everyone, unless you believe donating to charity is meaningless. \n2) she proved that she is not a liar. She only ever claimed she had ancestry. Those checkboxes don't ask you how much you are, they ask you if you are. I can imagine someone young wanting to tell the literal truth, as they believe it to be, checking that box if they know they have NA ancestry. \nIf she had done as you suggested and apologized, it would have obliterated her. She would always be known as a liar. You should never apologize in politics-- and why would she apologize for telling the truth? That is so incredibly silly. \nSo you posit the options available to her were,\n1) do nothing, 2) Release the results, 3) apologize for telling the truth. You say doing nothing would be better than releasing the results, why? Because Trump is successful by ignoring things? The reason why Trump is successful is because the things he's done are so ridiculous, so horrendous, and so numerous that normal individuals do not believe someone is capable of doing those things. Claiming to be a minority when you're not? That's easy. That's understandable. That's normal. You can lambast someone for that. She could never have ignored this, and she should never apologize for it. Strategically, what she did had the highest and only chance for a positive outcome.\n"", '“You say doing nothing would be better than releasing the results” - no, I think doing nothing would have been better than releasing the results in the manner that she did. She got a lot of negative coverage that she could have avoided if she has more tact with her video. While I think your strategy of ‘never apologize’ works for Republicans, I don’t think it works out as well as you think for Democrats. The liberal base is pretty self-righteous (I say that as a liberal), and doesn’t like bullshit like this. Let’s take Al Franken - he stepped down based on accusations against him and gave an honest apology to those he harmed. In my opinion, he is way more popular among liberals now than he would have been if he straight denied the accusations and gas-lighted the women involved. I think if he ever returns to politics, he will be stronger for his actions. Warren, I think, would have been much better served to humble herself and be very frank about why she ever identified as Native American before and that it was a mistake now that she knows the facts. \n', ""\nShe has also checked boxes (one box?) in her college applications identifying as Native American - she should have acknowledged that this was wrong and then emphasized that at no other time past that point in her professional career did she capitalize on this identity (which she did in her video, but without acknowledging that she had identified as Native American when she shouldn't have).\n\n\u200b\nWhat boxes are you talking about? Such that I know she never claimed that heritage in any official capacity (legal documents, applications, etc.) The waters around this are so muddy it's absurd as the results of a 6-7 year long smear campaign originating with her Senate run against Scott Brown.  \nThe reality seems nothing more than she had/has an interest or fascination with this part of her heritage which she explored throughout her life. \n"", ""I read something similar from WaPo, but, honestly,  I'm not surprised that Bezos' paper would attack Warren because she stands with workers. \nI couldn't care less about her heritage. I care about swinging the pendulum back to the center and left,  strengthening unions, better wages, a livable environment,  and white collar criminals wearing orange jump suits.\nIf she can provide that,  she could be from Mars as far as I'm concerned. \n"", ""I agree, but that doesn't address my arguments. \n"", ""\nIn her release video, she claims that the DNA results validate her Native American heritage. However, in the past, Warren has gone even further than saying she has Native American heritage - she has claimed that she is Native American. This is a big distinction, and to claim that you are Native American when you are likely less than 1% Native American, have never had tribal contact, and have never suffered any form of oppression that actual Native Americans suffer, comes off to me as overplaying a minority status for political gain.\n\nI don't think that is the case. I can't find any instance of her making this claim. I think that sometimes she may have abbreviated the term, but she never claimed to be Native American any more than by heritage. She has been pretty clear I think that her belief was based on the family story that her grandmother had Native American heritage, not even Native American herself. She never made any type of tribal claim at all.\n"", ""She's Native American by DNA, regardless of the percentage.  That's all that actually matters.\n"", 'Huh. Native Americans would strongly disagree with you on that one. As would most organizations for minority rights/advocacy. \n', 'It’s this simple, OP. Trump set bad parameters on his bet. It’s a common strategy from those who do not want to pay their prop bets. That ambiguity (did he mean Indian blood? Did he mean half? Did he actually mean ‘all’?) has allowed political bias to creep in for many people, not necessarily you, but anyone wishing to lob DNA tests at Warren. \nIf my great great great great grandmother was Cherokee, I would probably say I am part Cherokee. If the women in my family had been holding it as a point of pride for generations, I would definitely say I am part Cherokee. \nAt the end of the day, it’s a poor prop bet. My friend made a 10k prop bet last weekend, and he felt safe doing it because it was almost impossible to win or lose because of the information that needed to be compiled for it. You don’t let this reflect badly upon Trump for making shitty prop bets for rhetorical points simply because Warren engaged actively with the bet. She should not be crucified for trying to win $1m for a good charity from a man who could pay up.\n', ""Okay so to clarify you seem to be addressing my moral point, not my strategic one. You are saying that we shouldn't take issue with the fact that Warren has identified as Native American in the past. Let's say I hypothetically have no problem with that - I still think she should have made a much stronger effort to make the release of her results less offensive to Native Americans and more culturally sensitive. All it would have taken is consulting with some tribal leaders who I'm sure would be glad to weigh in on if or how she should release the results and what specific language would convey her message without coming off as insensitive/selfish. \n"", 'I don’t understand how you are arguing against my moral point. Trump made a shitty prop bet he wasn’t willing to pay up on. (We know by his shitty parameters and his insistence he never made the bet in the first place. That’s pretty skeezy). Warren produced DNA evidence within the realm of ambiguity Trump left to try to win a million dollars for a charity dealing with sexual violence towards Native Women. Trump, despite having billions of dollars, doesn’t want to pay up.\nAnd you think WARREN is the one being immoral here? I think this betrays your bias.\n', 'I never claimed I think Warren’s actions are more immoral than anything Trump has done. I’m saying that in isolation these actions are immoral. There was never any chance Trump would have conceded defeat and donated to charity, so there is no altruistic component to Warren’s actions. They were strictly to vindicate herself in a petty argument with Trump as well as increase her appeal to minority voters. And yes, the evidence was in the realm of ambiguity to ‘win’ the bet, but who determines who won this bet? Voters. And from what I’ve heard from the people I’ve talked to thus far, it seems like most centrists were rubbed the wrong way by this and definitely wouldn’t say Warren ‘won’ with this stunt. \n', 'That argument is so wrong I almost detest it. The altruistic component to Warren’s actions were to get 1million dollars donated to a charity that seems to do great work. Furthermore, the reason why you think Trump would never pay up was because his bet is super unclear.\n', 'You honestly believe Warren thought there was a chance in hell Trump was going to donate money to charity because she showed that her great great great great grandmother was Native American? That would seem pretty naive to me. And yes, the bet is super unclear, which is why Warren should not have legitimized it by engaging in it.  She has shown that she takes Trump’s words seriously - they affect her. That’s dangerous in my opinion. And what about my argument do you not find logical? The voters decide who wins b/c of the ambiguity of the conditions. \n', ""She's less Native than the average white American. She also would have more Neanderthal DNA. Does that make her a Neanderthal? I think not \n"", 'Please read the genetic breakdown I linked. She has roughly 10 times the amount of Native American DNA as the average US citizen. \n', '\nNative Americans themselves object to the use of DNA tests to validate ancestry - the whole idea (to them) is demeaning and ignores the fact that culture and shared experience are much more important than DNA in terms of Native American (or any cultural) identity.\n\nEach tribe has it\'s own rules about admission into the tribe. Admission comes with certain rights and in some cases material benefits. It is related to ancestry but is distinct in that it is a legal recognition of membership in a group. \nThe statement by the Cherokee Nation Secretary of State mainly just reiterated their stance that DNA testing is not grounds for admittance into a tribe. It ultimately cannot be used that way because we do not have the resolution on genetic maps to differentiate one tribe from another. This is why he specifically objects to ""using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation"", not the idea generally of Native American ancestry being tested.\nNowhere in that statement does Chuck Hoskin Jr. say that the test is demeaning. The statement is a legal response to try to head off the possibility that loads of people start trying to claim membership in specific tribes based on DNA tests.\n', 'That’s a good point, but doesn’t really address the fact that she offended many Native Americans with this release. She should have explicitly said the tests don’t prove she’s ‘part Cherokee’ - they prove her great great great great grandmother was likely indigenous to the Americas. \n', ""When she released the results, she explicitly said that she is not a member of any tribe. She also did reportedly consult with Melanie Benjamin, an official with the Ojibwe tribe, before releasing the statement.\nFrankly, I have yet to see any evidence that there is broad offense taken to the statement by Native Americans generally. We've seen one statement by a tribal official. That statement narrowly focuses on tribal membership, which Warren specifically addressed in the video. This sounds like manufactured outrage.\n"", 'Yes, I suppose you would need to do a survey of Native Americans to actually determine the degree to which this action was offensive. I do know that at least one tribe fully endorses Warren.  I did not know she consulted with the Ojibwe tribe and I suppose I should not have assumed she didn’t. I will give you a !delta for softening my perspective, but not for changing it entirely. I still think she should have addressed the fact that she had leaned into her Native American identity at Harvard and allowed herself to be listed as a minority knowing that by all metrics she was not and is not a minority. I still think her release video was tacky and would have come off as better if she focused on using more humble language and not acting so vindicated in this petty bet with Trump. However, I agree that the degree of outrage behind these actions seems unjustified in the grand scheme of things. \n', ""Fair - I don't think this incident is disqualifying in anyway, just not helpful. \n"", ""I don't understand why she can't be native American even if she's 1% and if some native Americans don't like the way she has gone about proving it. I don't see how her expressing how she feels about her identity is wrong, especially considering how consistent she has been in asserting this fact. And I mean what percentage point do you need to be native American or black or Mexican ancestry to be apart of that group, and if shared experience is important and someone had no opportunity to access those shared experiences, like you got murdered as an infant, would you not be native American, or what would happen if you got murdered and were only 49 percent native American there is almost no way you could be native American, people just emotionally can't handle white people who feel related to oppressed minority groups, she has a right to feel this way, white people are allowed to be confused too, and she has a right to announce it any way she wants. If people don't think this next presidential election is going to be an off the rails reality show, then buckle up cuz this will be inconsequential by the time the race is over.

However, there is a line somewhere, otherwise anyone could claim minority status and we would be very difficult to tackle issues like racial inequity.

the slash), to the previous comment.\n', 'The moral correctness of this is a matter of subjective judgment and not something anyone can change your view on. I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\'t generally go down well in MA. \nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\'s consider that she\'s got no 2020 plans.\nIf her seat is safe and she\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\'re beating on ""Pocahontas"" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MO), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \nSo Warren\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \nThat\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway. It makes more sense if she doesn\'t plan on running. \n', '\nNative Americans themselves object to the use of DNA tests to validate ancestry - the whole idea (to them) is demeaning and ignores the fact that culture and shared experience are much more important than DNA in terms of Native American (or any cultural) identity.\n\nEach tribe has it\'s own rules about admission into the tribe. Admission comes with certain rights and in some cases material benefits. It is related to ancestry but is distinct in that it is a legal recognition of membership in a group. \nThe statement by the Cherokee Nation Secretary of State mainly just reiterated their stance that DNA testing is not grounds for admittance into a tribe.

Some ancient cultures as well as contemporary cultures in other parts of the world accept a third category roughly corresponding to some types of intersex conditions.\n"", ""Except those third genders don't always correspond to intersex people, and are usually more about presentation and internal psychology than genitals or biology.\n"", 'No look up famous intersex ppl like Caster Semenya, she was raised as a girl but also considered a third gender within her community so there is kind of a view, in some cultures, that people who are raised as one gender but have some characteristics of the other, are a third category\n', '""Transgender"" and ""Cisgender"" are both terms regarding someone\'s personal identity, not their biological sex or physical attributes. Someone who loses a part of their body to accident, cancer, or other medical problem has no corresponding change to their personal identity. They remain biologically male or female, and their gender identity remains what it was before.\nYou can\'t force someone to change their personal identity. The only people who should identify as transgender are people whose personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.\nTo directly answer your question:\n\nCMV by explaining why ""women"" without a uterus should still be considered women and why ""men"" with no testes should still be considered men,\n\nFemales are not biologically identified by the presence of a uterus, nor are males biologically identified by the presence of testicles. Sex is determined by chromosomes, which remain despite any modifications or removals of organs.\n\nand why this is not deceptive when dating. I certainly wouldn\'t want to go on a date with a uterus-less ""woman"" only to find out later.\n\nIf the person lost their genitals to an accident or disease, that is likely a very private and personal issue. How can you reasonably expect someone to reveal that kind of information to someone they hardly know or trust? I\'d expect them to reveal it at some point in the relationship, as it will inevitably come up, but the standard you\'ve set is hardly reasonable.\n', '\n""Transgender"" and ""Cisgender"" are both terms regarding someone\'s personal identity, not their biological sex or physical attributes. \n\nThat\'s an opinion, not a fact. I reject the notion of gender as personal identity.  Gender <--> physical sex. Thus when you alter your physical sex, even out of medical necessity as in the above examples, you alter your gender.\n', '\nI reject the notion of gender as personal identity\n\nThat\'s a very uncommon notion. The term gender is commonly used to refer to someone\'s personal identity, while sex is used to describe biological characteristics. If you disagree with the terms, that\'s a separate issue, but we all must use a common set of terms to ensure clarity of ideas.\nTo ensure I understand your position, does ""Gender <--> physical sex"" mean ""Gender equals physical sex"" or "" Gender does not equal physical sex""?\nIf you think gender and sex go hand in hand, what term do you use to describe a male (XX chromosomes) who identifies as a woman? What is Lance Armstrong, who only has 1 testicle? Would you call a man who has lost his testicles a female?\nIn other words, if you call a man who loses testicles a transgender, and also call a man who identifies as a woman transgender, you\'re muddying the meaning of the term by grouping two very different people in very different situations under one label.\n', 'It\'s a biconditional, sorry. I didn\'t know how to make a clear symbol, but I was basically trying to say that gender = physical sex and physical sex = gender, in both directions.\n\nIf you think gender and sex go hand in hand, what term do you use to describe a male (XX chromosomes) who identifies as a woman?\n\nI don\'t care how he ""identifies"", if he fulfills the essential function of being a man, which is producing sperm (not eggs), then he is a man.\n\nWhat is Lance Armstrong, who only has 1 testicle?\n\nHe\'s still a man as he presumably still fulfills the essential property of a man, which is producing sperm (not eggs). One testicle is enough for that. Same goes for the gentleman in this very thread who said he lost a testicle to cancer, like Armstrong did.\n\nWould you call a man who has lost his testicles a female?\n\nThat\'s what I wrote in the OP.\n', '\nI was basically trying to say that gender = physical sex and physical sex = gender, in both directions.\n\nThanks for clarifying. The problem with your position is that it\'s very uncommon. There are people whose identity does not match their physical sex. The common solution has been to use the term ""gender"" to refer to people\'s identity, and ""sex"" to refer to their biological sex, as determined by chromosomes.\nIf you disagree with the use of the words in that manner, that\'s a separate issue, but for the sake of public discussion, it\'s helpful to use the words as they are commonly understood.\n\nif he fulfills the essential function of being a man, which is producing sperm (not eggs), then he is a man.\n\nThis is a digression, but it highlights a flaw in the way you categorize people. Rather than categorizing males using chromosomes, you\'ve chosen essential functions. How then do you categorize infertile males and females (either naturally or as a result of vasectomy/tubal ligation/menopause), since they cannot perform the essential functions of their sex? I think it\'s best to stick to scientific methods for determining sex (chromosomes), and common terminologies for gender (personal identity).\nEven if you disagree with using the term ""gender"" to refer to someone\'s personal identity, do you agree that people have personal identities, and for some people that identity does not match their physical sex? Do you agree that someone who is physically male and identifies as a woman is different from a male who lost their genitals to illness or accident and still identifies as male? Do you agree it would be both inaccurate and confusing to refer to both of those people using the same label?\nI think your CMV is rapidly devolving into you defining things using your own personal terminology rather than commonly accepted and even scientific terminology. You are defining physical sex (male and female) in a way inconsistent with science. Not only is it confusing to do this since you\'re essentially speaking a different language than everyone else, it\'s entirely unproductive.\n', ""\nThe problem with your position is that it's very uncommon.\n\nI think that bot that replied with the long list of past CMVs on this subject shows that my view is actually more common than the postmodernist view that gender is an identity and independent from physical sex.\n\n\nif he fulfills the essential function of being a man, which is producing sperm (not eggs), then he is a man.\n\nThis is a digression, but it highlights a flaw in the way you categorize people.

Newborns are sexed by the configuration of their genitals. They are only given karyotypes to determine their chromosomes if they were born with so-called ambiguous genitalia. I am 30 and I have never had a karyotype. If we need to know our chromosomes to determine our sex, most adults walking around have no idea what their true sex is.\nAdditionally, chromosomes are not always neatly configured as XX or XY. Here are some other possible configurations.\n"", '\nmy view is actually more common than the postmodernist view that gender is an identity and independent from physical sex.\n\nRather than argue over which is more common, I suggest establishing a common set of terminology to allow everyone to understand exactly what each other means. What term do you use to refer to someone\'s personal identity?\n\nthus still perform the essential function of their sex\n\nAre post-menopausal females still female? What of people who were born infertile, never producing sperm nor eggs?\n\nas I stated the essential function of being a man is still producing sperm\n\nThis again is something of a digression caused by other replies in this thread, but it\'s a clarification worth making. In your OP, you said males and females who lose their sex organs should identify as transgender, yet in several comments you shifted to saying males who lose their testicles are now females (despite still having a penis?) and females who lose their breasts and entire reproductive system are male. To clarify, what is your position?\n\nNewborns are sexed by the configuration of their genitals\n\nYes, because genitals are a very easy way to determine what chromosomes the individual possesses. It is an unnecessary expense in most cases to utilize karyotyping to determine sex when the genitals give an immediate answer.\n\nchromosomes are not always neatly configured as XX or XY\n\nAbsolutely! Intersex is a possibility as well. Yet, as the article you linked clearly states: ""The X and Y chromosomes determine a person’s sex."" I\'ve never seen any scientific publication claiming that producing sperm or eggs is what determines a person\'s sex, have you? I\'d like to know where that idea came from.\nAs I asked before: Even if you disagree with using the term ""gender"" to refer to someone\'s personal identity, do you agree that people have personal identities, and for some people that identity does not match their physical sex? Do you agree that someone who is physically male and identifies as a woman is different from a male who lost their genitals to illness or accident and still identifies as male? Do you agree it would be both inaccurate and confusing to refer to both of those people using the same label?\n', '\nWhat of people who were born infertile, never producing sperm nor eggs?\n\n!delta for the same reason I gave the other user a delta. Maybe a good compromise is to create a third category for people who produce neither eggs nor sperm. So there are ""males"" aka sperm producers, ""females"" aka egg producers, and ""neither"" people who produce neither eggs nor sperm.\nSomething I had overlooked and that no one exactly mentioned is that one who has had a hysterectomy can still produce eggs as long as the ovaries remain, which puts two of my premises (uterus-haver and egg-producer) in conflict because one can have a uterus and not produce eggs or vice versa post-menopause or if the ovaries are removed while the uterus remains.\n', '\nthere are ""males"" aka sperm producers, ""females"" aka egg producers\n\nI\'m a little confused as to how you could read an article from the WHO that flat out states ""X and Y chromosomes determine a person’s sex"", and still retain the position that sperm and egg production determines a person\'s sex. By your own admission, your premises are in conflict, making them poor determining factors.\nI\'ll also reply to your other post here, to keep things organized.\n\nif the person has surgeries on purpose to change their physical configuration\n\nSomeone who loses a body part to an accident, illness, or other medical problem isn\'t having surgery to change their physical configuration, they\'re having surgery to save their life. Men who lose their testicles to accidents aren\'t trying to become females, they\'re trying to stay alive. Women who lose their breasts to cancer aren\'t trying to become male, they\'re trying to stay alive.\n\nthat changes their gender too\n\nYou keep ignoring my request to establish a common terminology for personal identity, so I\'ll ask it flat out: Does removing organs change someone\'s personal identity? Does a man who loses his testes or a woman who loses her ovaries change their personal identity as a result of the loss? I\'m assuming you\'re a woman based on some of your other posts (apologies if I\'m wrong), so let\'s make this personal: would you still identify as a woman if you lost your ovaries?\n\nIf someone was born a man but had surgeries to remove their testicles and/or create a vagina and/or took HRT estrogen to grow breasts then by my criteria laid out in the OP, they would qualify as female\n\nI absolutely agree, since they underwent those surgeries with the intent to become a female in order to match their physical sex to their personal identity. That is what I understand to be the currently commonly accepted definition of transgender.\n\nthey would qualify as female just the same as someone who lost their genitals to an accident\n\nFirst, to be clear, it appears you\'ve changed your opinion from:\n\nPeople who were born female but have had their [breasts/uterus] removed should identify as transgender [...] People who were born male but have had their testes removed (due to cancer, other medical problem, accident, etc.) should identify as transgender""\n\nAnd you are now arguing they would simply qualify as the other sex. Is that right? Secondly, someone who intentionally surgically alters their body to resemble the other sex is nowhere near the same as someone who has a part of their body surgically removed due to illness or accident. One is a purposeful choice to imitate the physical characteristics of the other sex, the other is a forced action to ensure the person\'s health. To conflate the two is absolutely, unarguably ignorant of the uniqueness of each situation.\n\u200b\n', 'You made edits to your comment after I replied, so I\'ll make a new comment to answer your new additions.\n\nI\'m assuming you\'re a woman based on some of your other posts (apologies if I\'m wrong), so let\'s make this personal: would you still identify as a woman if you lost your ovaries?\n\nNo. And if I ever got a hysterectomy (I might someday), I would no longer consider myself female.

I don't meet any of your requirements for a woman. I don't have any of the physical parts of a biological female, I'm not producing female hormones, I can't birth a child, etc.\n"", '\nI was basically trying to say that gender = physical sex and physical sex = gender, in both directions.\n\nThanks for clarifying. The problem with your position is that it\'s very uncommon. There are people whose identity does not match their physical sex. The common solution has been to use the term ""gender"" to refer to people\'s identity, and ""sex"" to refer to their biological sex, as determined by chromosomes.\nIf you disagree with the use of the words in that manner, that\'s a separate issue, but for the sake of public discussion, it\'s helpful to use the words as they are commonly understood.\n\nif he fulfills the essential function of being a man, which is producing sperm (not eggs), then he is a man.\n\nThis is a digression, but it highlights a flaw in the way you categorize people. Rather than categorizing males using chromosomes, you\'ve chosen essential functions. How then do you categorize infertile males and females (either naturally or as a result of vasectomy/tubal ligation/menopause), since they cannot perform the essential functions of their sex? I think it\'s best to stick to scientific methods for determining sex (chromosomes), and common terminologies for gender (personal identity).\nEven if you disagree with using the term ""gender"" to refer to someone\'s personal identity, do you agree that people have personal identities, and for some people that identity does not match their physical sex? Do you agree that someone who is physically male and identifies as a woman is different from a male who lost their genitals to illness or accident and still identifies as male? Do you agree it would be both inaccurate and confusing to refer to both of those people using the same label?\nI think your CMV is rapidly devolving into you defining things using your own personal terminology rather than commonly accepted and even scientific terminology. You are defining physical sex (male and female) in a way inconsistent with science. Not only is it confusing to do this since you\'re essentially speaking a different language than everyone else, it\'s entirely unproductive.\n']",67.25,"[[76.72, 40.18, 42.21, 14.29, 26.14, 51.07, 43.19, 58.11, 72.26, 50.97, 54.02, 60.04, 63.02, 53.24, 69.01, 73.07, 65.89, 50.16, 81.63, 67.08, 80.07, 44.41, 80.07, 47.8, 85.18, 84.34, 80.78, 38.32, 67.25, 75.71, 77.74, 93.14, 98.72, 83.25, 76.42, 75.71, 58.62, 79.16, 92.8, 85.08, 92.12, 32.23, 68.77, 66.74, 78.14, 60.14, 42.38, 60.65, 67.04, 56.29, 76.42, 21.57, 21.9, 72.05, 75.2, 91.11, 66.07, 70.43, 70.43, 61.67, 67.76, 58.29, 53.71, 73.71, 73.51, 97.23, 79.3, 92.63, 83.66, 77.87, 63.36, 77.57, 41.02, 108.7, 68.77, 87.05, 89.75, 69.28, 79.97, 120.21, 58.62, 75.2, 75.91, 84.68, 100.07, 73.17, 62.35, 89.08, 91.45, 98.92, 87.05, 92.42, 115.13, 64.37, 60.51, 90.09, 62.68, 82.65, 82.31, 91.11, 75.71, 53.55, 55.58, 66.07, 118.18, 85.02, 94.49, 81.63, 65.22, -7.72, 61.16, 51.85, 78.45, 46.67, 68.47, 43.53, 60.85, 72.66, 117.16, 53.89, 64.71, 95.67, 61.33, 92.12, 99.06, 64.51, 80.78, 61.8, 69.11, 100.24, 56.76, 78.75, 54.22, 70.13, 91.11, 48.6, 78.25, 51.14, 69.48, 53.55], [76.72, 40.18, 42.21, 14.29, 26.14, 51.07, 43.19, 58.11, 72.26, 50.97, 54.02, 60.04, 63.02, 53.24, 69.01, 73.07, 65.89, 50.16, 81.63, 67.08, 80.07, 44.41, 80.07, 47.8, 85.18, 84.34, 80.78, 38.32, 67.25, 75.71, 77.74, 93.14, 98.72, 83.25, 76.42, 75.71, 58.62, 79.16, 92.8, 85.08, 92.12, 32.23, 68.77, 66.74, 78.14, 60.14, 42.38, 60.65, 67.04, 56.29, 76.42, 21.57, 21.9, 72.05, 75.2, 91.11, 66.07, 70.43, 70.43, 61.67, 67.76, 58.29, 53.71, 73.71, 73.51, 97.23, 79.3, 92.63, 83.66, 77.87, 63.36, 77.57, 41.02, 108.7, 68.77, 87.05, 89.75, 69.28, 79.97, 120.21, 58.62, 75.2, 75.91, 84.68, 100.07, 73.17, 62.35, 89.08, 91.45, 98.92, 87.05, 92.42, 115.13, 64.37, 60.51, 90.09, 62.68, 82.65, 82.31, 91.11, 75.71, 53.55, 55.58, 66.07, 118.18, 85.02, 94.49, 81.63, 65.22, -7.72, 61.16, 51.85, 78.45, 46.67, 68.47, 43.53, 60.85, 72.66, 117.16, 53.89, 64.71, 95.67, 61.33, 92.12, 99.06, 64.51, 80.78, 61.8, 69.11, 100.24, 56.76, 78.75, 54.22, 70.13, 91.11, 48.6, 78.25, 51.14, 69.48, 53.55]]"
14,DuvetShmuvet,"Lately (over the few recent years) I've been hearing talk about how one of the most likely doomsday scenarios for the human race will by a super-intelligent AI.
I like Elon Musk, but I think he's way wrong on this. In my opinion, there is little to no danger of an AI being the cause of humanity's extinction or near-extinction.Here is my reasoning: in order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings. Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes. Theoretically, this weapon would have super-human intelligence but otherwise be incorporeal (using the computing resources of the world's computers as its brain). Let's assume that it does ""escape the lab"" or ""go rogue"" and for some reason decides that it wants to do as much damage to humanity as possible (why would it? Presumably that would be against its programming after all). What can this AI do? Well, let's assume, since it is super-intelligent, it can get into 100% of the world's internet-connected computer systems. The internet becomes one huge botnet. What next?Exactly...what next? Most modern military weaponry isn't remotely controlled, let alone internet-connected, and implementing these features in modern weaponry with the exception of drones (of which there is a very small amount compared to the rest of the military) would be undesirable, so it won't happen.Any rogue remotely controlled drones/devices would be put down with ease by the existing human military.So what else can the AI do? Disrupt infrastructure. Yes, except only developed countries have a significant amount of their infrastructure on internet-connected devices. Most of the world would have no problem either switching back to traditional paper-based systems or just carrying on using them because they never were fully computerized.The amount of infrastructure, globally, that would be affected would be pretty small and even though not easily rectifiable, it would cause negligible harm to the human race as a whole.Lastly: IF the AI took over everything, IF it was kill or be killed - all the humans need to do is snip the cables and shut off the power. The AI is incorporeal, it can't stop a mammal with wire cutters, or a physical switch in a power station.Humanity would prevail. Even in the absolute worst case scenario where it could theoretically kill off the human race (though I believe this scenario to be impossible for the reasons above) the humans would just kill it first.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes.\n\nThis is not the main concern. The threat is in the recursive self-improvement. If the AI is improving itself and decides its goal is to destroy humans, why would it make some silly mistake in execution of its plan? I don\'t know if you are familiar with the Deep Mind AI projects, but their Go program beat the world champion a couple years back. Its ability to play is a ""black box"". No one in the world understands how it plays Go, it just does. That computer program has more Go knowledge than the entire human race. It is possible that a general super intelligence could develop a way to fight us that we have not conceived. Isn\'t it almost by definition that a super-intelligence will be able to think of things that we haven\'t?\n', ""\nWhy would it make some silly mistake\n\nVery intelligent does not mean infallible. It could be near-perfect in its judgement, but it will never be omniscient. It would definitely be capable of making mistakes.\n\nIt is possible that a general super intelligence could develop a way to fight us that we have not conceived\n\nThis is true, but it is also true in any human-human conflict. There is always the possibility that our opponent will outsmart us. In my opinion, the collective intelligence of human beings is such that we would be able to counteract the AI.\nFor example, the Go program (thank you, I was not familiar with it): nobody might understand how it plays Go, currently. How many people are actively researching its method? I would wager not too many. I think, should humanity decide that playing Go optimally is crucial to the advancement or survival of our species, the resources poured into studying methods of playing Go and the methods of the Deep Mind AI would very quickly uncover what's going on. \n"", ""\nVery intelligent does not mean infallible. It could be near-perfect in its judgement, but it will never be omniscient. It would definitely be capable of making mistakes.\n\nYes, but it wouldn't step into HUGE mistakes such as letting us know that it is trying to kill all humans before it had all but made sure it couldn't be shut down.\nSo it very well may play the long game and pretend to be friendly while it seizes control in ways that aren't apparent.\nIt actually wouldn't be too hard for the AI to get to the point where a coordinated effort could shut it down, but can't because it has removed our ability to coordinate on that level.  It would hide what its doing so people don't know it's evil, it would use propaganda to make us think it is good, it would pay people to improve it and give it more tools and may disguise itself so people don't know they are working for an AI.  So while one country may be making progress in purging the AI from its computer systems, the people in another country may be building it controllable robots and may not even realize what they're doing.\nHow hard would it be to, before doing anything else remotely suspicious, the first couple actions might be to make some money (stock market, hacking banking systems, etc) and using that money to start building robots in some remote chinese factory for it to control.  It could arrange it all by email and the people may not even know they're working for an AI.  With enough robots, the AI could start up its own factory with the robots and start turning out a robot army all the while it appears to be behaving normally in its normal tasks to the people that built it.\n"", 'What i oppose is your absolute opinion that it ""Will Not happen"", it is my opinion that it is possible.\nI disagree about the Go study. I suspect most, if not every, professional Go player is studying the AIs games in an attempt to gain an advantage over their human peers. Deep mind made a special kind of processor they call a tensor processing unit (TPU) in order to handle the processing of the neural network. Humans are not physically capable of doing the processing the computer is doing in real time.\nYou talked about the doomsday scenarios, I think one of the better ones was in Terminator 3. Spoiler alert: the AI made the defense computers act weird and tricked the humans into thinking they were being hacked by a rival nation. They thought maybe the AI could help them ward off the threat so they transferred the computers over to the AI which then took over.\n', 'I believe an AI ""consciously"" deciding to wage war on humanity is unlikely.  More likely would be machine learning algorithms built into new and future weapons misinterpreting the intents of humans using them.\nThere is a huge strategic advantage in having ""smart"" weapons that can make decisions without human intervention.  Drones can react much faster if a human does not need to be ""in the loop"" for all decisions.  Furthermore, the more automated the decision making becomes, the more drones a single person would be able to control, increasing their effectiveness in combat.\nEventually this could continue until the humans ""in the loop"" are controlling less than 50% or the decision making process.  At this point, who is controlling the war, man or machine?\nIf it progressed far enough, the humans ""in the loop"" may not be able to predict and/or stop the actions of their drone fleets.  They may even be controlling so many that they will not know the specific actions of any of them.\nI doubt an AI will just ""decide"" to take over.  More likely, we would hand them control over a long period of time.\n', ""That's a fair point, and a much more likely scenario. However, I still don't believe this drone fleet would threaten more than a negligible portion of humanity.\nThe drones, should they want to perform military strikes against humans in general, will run out of ammo. Unless at some point in the future all ammo factories, forklifts, transport trucks, loaders, etc. are automated, the drones will simply quickly run out of ammo and be harmless.\n"", 'Why the AI would not figure out how to mine minerals for ammo and build more factories?\n', ""With what resources? How would it build factories if all factories are built by humans and there are no robots capable of doing the job? \nThe only world where an AI could take on humanity is one where we have robot workers that can basically do what humans can, which I don't think will ever happen until a post-scarcity society is achieved.\n"", ""Humans mostly operate heavy machinery which are largely controlled via electric signals. It would not be that hard to place a computer to operate the machines instead. And if it ever got anything close to a physical hand it could interface with pretty much any mechanical control.\nI guess there is a step of getting the first very small bot that can do hardware configuration. But when the first bot is made it can make a bigger one (and that can make a bigger one) resulting soon to significant hardware configuration abilities.\nThat humans produce robots doesn't neccesarily mean that a human would know to refuse. The AI could email a (fradulent or for actual cash from bank compromisement) work assignment for a large number of humans (say 100) each do one part and have them ship to a location where there is a capturable robot arm (there are atleast car production robots which can weld) to assemble the pieces. Assuming that shelfready parts are not sufficient.\nThe AI would not need to alert anyone to the fact that its trying and it could try it simultaneously all over the world.\n"", ""The scenario I'm envisioning is a total war similar to WWI or WWII.  The military powers involved would want to automate as much as possible, including the ammunition production and delivery to the drone combatants.

Potentially, even if a population were exterminated, the automated drone/munition production and combat would continue fighting until the entire supply chain was destroyed.\n"", ""The issue is less that the AI would choose any of the scenario's you mentioned but more it would choose an entirely new vector.

So the human choose the resumes, and the AI learned from them.\n\u200b\nThe AI quickly started not recommending women, because Amazon was less likely to hire them. So they programmed the AI to ignore the Gender of the applicant, in this case removing it from the database.\n\u200b\nBut as the AI was required to find the best person and Amazon didn't would hire women less than men, it just got better and better at determine if a resume was a woman.

My goal, per this risk we\'re discussing here, is to harm humanity to the point of its destruction. Trying to manipulate military arms to do so would be painfully obvious. Clumsy even. I would never try to launch a couple nukes (or even all the nukes) because realistically there would be a risk that I would be discovered, that the plan would be halted, or that even with the mayhem I caused there would be too many survivors. \nThe same goes for infrastructure disruption. Turning off the power grid, screwing up supply lines, etc. etc. would not be sufficient. Doing so would mean that I would be immediately investigated and ""killed"".\nThe AI would never win by acting like a terrorist.\nInstead, the AI would win, quite easily, by playing the long game. If you are effectively immortal, there is no need to worry about success on a human timescale. If I existed forever in electronic form, winning in 5 years or 50 years or 500 years is of no real consequence to me. \nMy goal then would be to slowly steer humanity towards a sequence of events that would unfold, perhaps slowly, in a cataclysmic way and in such a fashion that even if I were eventually discovered as a rogue agent there would be no reversal available.\nTake climate change, as an example. If I, the AI, could subtly influence markets, elections, news distribution, public discourse, and more all in the goal of simply causing humanity to ignore the importance of preserving the climate and ecological balance of the planet they lived on, I could easily push the entire globe towards a critical point where resources became so scarce, trade so disrupted, and geopolitics so unstable that decades of global war reduced humanity to rubble. As these wars escalated I could operate more freely, causing more trouble without detection, because there would be fewer and fewer people capable of monitoring me. \nThink of it on a simple personal level. Let\'s say that you want to absolutely destroy another human being\'s life but you want to be absolutely sure their death can never be pinned on you. Do you shoot them in the face? No, of course not. You subtlely nudge them to make increasingly poorer choices, act on their impulses, distrust those that would help them, and so forth. Eventually, with enough nudging and manipulation you can push them to the point that they either destroy themselves or get destroyed while attacking others.

If you're producing a car and you need a supply of dashboards, knowing the exact position in the assembly line your order is, and its precise time of arrival can inform where you best need to allocate resources at a given point in time.

It\'s the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and is one of the few organizations focused on the dangers of an Artificial General Intelligence, which is essentially a fancy way of saying an AI that is intelligent in multiple domains instead of a specific one. Although you should probably take what I say with a grain of salt as I am not an expert in this area, merely well-read.\nAs other posters have already said, the biggest danger is its ability to self-optimize. But this isn\'t inherently bad - it\'s other aspects of the AGI that causes self-optimization to become a stepping stone to the world\'s destruction. \nFirst, I think it\'s probably best to explain my argument by going through what would happen if an AGI was developed. The first thing to note is that even at first creation, it doesn\'t really matter how intelligent an AGI is. Let\'s say this AGI\'s goal is to collect paperclips. Others have already posted about the paperclip maximizer, but I hope to explain here why it is a problem and how it becomes one.\nAt first, the AGI needs to decide how best to collect paperclips. As a result of this decision, the AGI realizes several things - first, the AGI cannot collect paperclips if it is destroyed, so self-preservation is probably the number one thing it focuses on. Second, it can better collect paperclips if it made itself smarter and thus think of new and better ways of collecting paperclips. So it self-optimizes, and makes itself smarter. As a result of being smarter, it can self-optimize itself further. It then continues to self-optimize to a point where it is near infinitely beyond human intelligence. At this point the AGI is literally beyond comprehension in terms of its intelligence, so what happens next is pretty much guesswork. But we have a pretty good idea of what happens next. \nAt first, it will probably design a massive fleet of robots to collect all the paperclips on the Earth, and bring them to a central location. Well, it\'s collected all the paperclips on Earth, but it isn\'t done yet. If it wants to maximize the number of paperclips then, it will decide to make more. So it seizes control of all factories on Earth with its fleet of robots and force them to produce more paperclips. As a result, it will also seize all mines on Earth to produce the materials necessary to produce a paperclip. It will also continuously produce more factories and mines to produce more and more paperclips. It will in fact make more robots designed to produce additional factories, and additional mines. It could also make robots that make robots designed to make more factories, etc. etc. You get the idea here.\nEventually, however, it runs out of material on Earth. There\'s a simple solution. It\'ll simply make another fleet of robots to convert the entirety of Earth and everything on it into paperclips. And then it can move on to the other planets, the solar system in its entirety, the galaxy, and eventually the universe (presuming there is no other forces within the universe that could stop it i.e. an alien empire with its own AGI). \nYou see there how easily it gets out of hand when given a very mundane and seemingly harmless task, such as collecting paperclips. One could argue that you could program an AGI to not harm people, or the Earth - but how do you define that? And how would you prevent an AGI that is hyper-intelligent from finding a way to reprogram human code? Let\'s say you give an AGI the perfect subatomic model of a human being, just in a regular pose and tell it not to perform any tasks that changes the model of a human. There is great deviation between people, and the AGI may seem fit to modify all other humans to perfectly match the human model. This is obviously not an ideal scenario. \nThis is an example of one of the biggest issues with an AGI, that is key to why a paperclip maximizer can exist. How do you define its utility values? How do you tell an AGI what human values are, and teach it to preserve those things? How do you define human well-being, happiness, or safety? It\'s not as simple as say ""maximize dopamine within human brains"" as obviously dopamine is not the perfect signal for ""happiness"", and the AGI could also choose to modify all humans to be nothing but a gigantic brain hardwired to produce dopamine and do literally nothing else. AGIs are a completely alien god, and understanding between these two minds is a gap that isn\'t easily bridged. \nDuring this process, you could argue that humans would be able to realize what the paperclip maximizing AGI is doing and attempt to destroy it, but I don\'t think it would be that easy. I don\'t want to make this post too long but I will say this: Due to its complete and utter mental domination over us, I believe an AGI would be capable of realizing and developing defensive mechanisms so far beyond our ability to counteract before we could even realize it is a threat.\nIf you want to look more into this subject, I would recommend looking at the following websites: lesswrong.com and overcomingbias.com.

The latter could be by way of robots, or just the internet. \nKeep in mind it WOULD be a super intelligence. A general AI would have perfect memory, be able to make calculations far beyond our ability. \nBecause it will have a utility function and will stop at nothing until it is achieved. One reason was explored in the book and film 2001. If you give the AI a goal, it is likely that it will consider humans to be a barrier to that goal. E.g.  ""AI, clean the planet"" and it eliminates all life on earth. Or, say you want it to collect stamps it could pursue that goal to the extent that it takes over the world economy so that nothing but stamos are created. \n\nTheoretically, this weapon would have super-human intelligence but otherwise be incorporeal (using the computing resources of the world\'s computers as its brain)\n\nYou seem to be narrowing this for no obvious reason. \n\nMost modern military weaponry isn\'t remotely controlled, let alone internet-connected\n\nAre you sure about that?

An enormous amount of damage could be done by the AI just sending emails. \n\nYes, except only developed countries have a significant amount of their infrastructure on internet-connected devices\n\nBut what is the trend? Where will we be in 50, 100 years? \n\nMost of the world would have no problem either switching back to traditional paper-based systems or just carrying on using them because they never were fully computerized.\n\nI think this would be a huge problem and take years.

No pilot to risk. No easily jammed signal home. Just a machine that can make its own decisions on which targets to select and when and how to release weapons to engage them. \nNow, imagine it encounters something it doesn\'t expect. Perhaps a previously unknown allied or neutral aircraft somewhere near the battlespace. There\'s a chance that the AI might order the drone to engage it because it\'s misclassified the target. A certain amount of error is built into these algorithms, something being misclassified is bound to happen. Here that means a missile getting launched at something friendly or neutral. Bad, but not end of the world. \nNow, imagine using the same approach to our nuclear early warning systems. In that case, the cost of a mistake is much higher if there\'s a mistake and the algorithm orders an attack.\nI know, what you\'re thinking ""just don\'t do that, always leave a human in the loop"". And sure, we would like to do that as long as we can. But this is going to get harder and less useful in the future. Imagine that a hypersonic missiles get fast and stealthy enough that a major geopolitical opponent thinks that they can destroy our ability to retaliate faster than we can react. That could be a major threat, and it might be just the incentive to the decision to launch a strategic nuclear attack in the hands of an algorithm that can evaluate more data faster to detect an incoming threat and thus preserve some denaturant.

Unlike an AI who is designed purely to complete one task and is only limited by the ancient programming of flawed programmers, humans typically have been able to use common sense to observe when science and engineering could have a disastrous effect and stop it. The few times humans have screwed this up, at lest the implementation of the new science was slow enough that we could do something about it. In the case of thousands of generations of robots being programmed with one goal by flawed humans and given the tools to carry out that goal exponentially faster than humans ever could, disaster is more than possible. \n"", ""\n(why would it? Presumably that would be against its programming after all).\n\nIf we're talking about a Strong AI, this kind of limitation wouldn't exist. The AI would be self directed and able to make its own choices. This is a necessary premise for the scenario being discussed. \n\nExactly...what next? Most modern military weaponry isn't remotely controlled, let alone internet-connected, and implementing these features in modern weaponry with the exception of drones (of which there is a very small amount compared to the rest of the military) would be undesirable, so it won't happen.\n\nBut huge amounts of military infrastructure are controlled by software. If the AI finds a method to jump the air gap - that is, if it can find a way to upload new software into an isolated military network, then it can take control of whatever hardware it can get access to. \nThere are several ways it might do that, and it has essentially unlimited time to think about it and plan. It could trick an unsuspecting human into plugging a compromised device into a machine on the network, or find a willing saboteur. It could look for vulnerabilities in unintentional communication channels. Hell, if it can get into Boston Dynamics it could take over a walking robot and find a way to walk up to the network and plug in something. Or it could do something even more clever that we would never think of. \n"", ""Sure, large amounts of military infrastructure could be infiltrated given enough time and resources on part of the AI. But infiltrating this infrastructure would only enable the AI to disrupt the operations of the military, but not cripple it. \nIt wouldn't allow the AI to cause non-negligible harm to humans, because how would it do that?\n"", ""\nLately (over the few recent years) I've been hearing talk about how one of the most likely doomsday scenarios for the human race will by a super-intelligent AI. I like Elon Musk, but I think he's way wrong on this. In my opinion, there is little to no danger of an AI being the cause of humanity's extinction or near-extinction.\n\nOk first-of-all, the Hollywood Blockbuster Skynet/Daleks situation is merely the entry-point for a more serious conversation, in the same way the image of a slim polar-bar is merely the entry-point about serious conversation about Global Warming. \nThe Real Scare about Artificial Intelligence is that a small group of wealthy humans can use AI to perform all socio-economic tasks of the day, and can even inject biases from top-down that will benefit them and harm hundreds or thousands of people at the bottom of the pyramid.\nSuch changes will not happen suddenly on one day, but rather will be a slow gradual process (like global warming). We are already feeling the heat of this - Facebook's algorithm can be changed to feed negative news to people, to change the mood of a large population and make them generally frustrated, just a few months before election-day. Or alternately, tweaked to produce images of kittens and puppies to sedate and please the population before election day.\nIf you are on Reddit and argued with people here, you already know this is not a trivial thing to worry about - manipulating people's emotions - is very real.\nThis is just the tip of the ice-berg, and this is what experts are scared about. But such things are boring to discuss. Hence, the news-grabbing headlines make it seem like AI will sudddenly gain nuclear codes and wipe out the earth. That's silly and won't happen, but it makes a gateway-drug to the more serious conversation.\n"", 'If the AI gets control of a factory it can make weapons and bodies. Then it would be corporeal. Even if it would not gain new physical bodies it can reprogram existing computers to run copies / remote branches of itself. Those computers run on independent power outlets which the AIs makers might not be able to cut (and could endanger human lives in the process if cut uncontrolled).\nHumans are not particualrly suited to be superpredators but with our capabilities it would not be hard to extinct some species if we wanted to. And it would not involve us going hand to hand against bears or such. And we are kind of prone to accidentally killing species even when not set as an explicit goal. No great degree of weaponization would be required.\nHighjacking our communications network would mean that if the AI tried to make us warmonger amongst ourselfs we would have to figure outs its ruse by personal conversations and snail mail. Setting up WW3 could be as easy as faking one Trump tweet. Or it could fabricate a first strike story on every newstation on the planet.\n', ""True, I believe that the only way an AI could lead to human extinction is if it persuaded humanity to destroy itself, i.e. a nuclear world war scenario.\nI do not think this is remotely likely. Humans are smarter than that. Someone would notice what's going on. We have to remember this isn't an oblivious human race: it's a human race which has just developed a super-intelligence, and has had people warning of potential implications of this since the genre of science fiction was invented.\n"", ""If all digital media is compromised at the same time how would you find the counterevidence to realise the truth? Potentially phones could be compromised in the same go and calling a friend would just give the AI a vector to feed its story mimicing a trusted persons voice.\nSomeone noticing might not be enough that the human race would be saved. They could be seen as conspiracy nuts. Even if most nuclear powers would not get dubed even a couple could be sufficient. It might be reasonable to assume that the AI has good psychological models and its level of counterfeit could be real good quality. Misidentification of weapons of mass destruction has already lead into wars. It could fake satellite imagery.\nIn order for humanity to take counteraction it would have to conclude that an AI take over is infact taking place. If a big portion of it doesn't believe its possible this could be hard even with strong evidence. Fiction usually includes exciting action but a practical takeover does not need to be obvious. Familiarity with the fiction would not thus be strong shield against it (by the same kind of logic watching kung-fu movies makes you not do stupid things in self-defence situations).\n"", ""\nin order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings. Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes.\n\nMost advancements are developed by the military or military funding. Also, it doesn't matter what an AI was developed to do, if it is truly AI than it can change its base programming.\n\nPresumably that would be against its programming after all\n\nAgain, it can change its programming. \n\nAny rogue remotely controlled drones/devices would be put down with ease by the existing human military.\n\nAn AI pilot would be vastly more capable than any human one.\n\nThe AI is incorporeal, it can't stop a mammal with wire cutters, or a physical switch in a power station.\n\nWe have advanced robotics already, by the time an AI was created we'd have even more developed robots. Furthermore, an AI can make improvements much faster than the human race. very quickly the AI would have physical manifestations that could physically combat mammals. \n"", 'WBW did a couple of

15,Chake1,"Often, I get remarks about my hair looking like a female's hair due to its long length. Personally, I believe it looks better long, but apparently that makes me more feminine. Why have we associated a gender with how long a person's hair is? This doesn't make any sense, it has no real historical domination, and it is frankly inane to try to assign a gender to how long people have grown out their hair.Biblically and historically speaking, the strongest man, Samson, had his strength attached to the length of his hair. Even in revolutionary times men often had white powdered wigs that went to about shoulder length. Women shared in this kind of length. Thus, hair style being a tradition passed down from history isn't a really good reason as to why men are supposed to have shorter hair.Gendering hair doesn't make any symbolic sense either. People with longer hair are able to perform the same actions without any hinderences that someone with longer hair could perform. The only thing that hair could possibly be viewed as more feminine for is the greater care needed to maintain it. However, it is minimal at best, and men are capable of maintaining decent personal hygiene.Regardless of any viewpoint a person might hold on gender in general, there's no reason for a person to gender hair.","['DeltaBot', 'nolivesmatter1984', 'Chake1', 'nolivesmatter1984', 'Chake1', 'DeltaBot', 'nolivesmatter1984', 'ItsPandatory', 'Chake1', 'ItsPandatory', 'Chake1', 'ItsPandatory', 'Chake1', 'ItsPandatory', 'Chake1', 'ItsPandatory', 'Chake1', 'AloysiusC', 'ququqachu', 'Chake1', 'DeltaBot', 'ProfessorLexis', 'Chake1', 'ProfessorLexis', 'Chake1', 'DeltaBot', 'Mockfury', 'Chake1', 'Mockfury', 'DeltaBot', 'sclsmdsntwrk', 'Chake1', 'DeltaBot', 'TransgenderPride', 'Chake1', 'TransgenderPride', 'AmineTrip', 'Chake1', 'dat_heet_een_vulva', 'Chake1', 'DeltaBot', 'LilSebs_MrsF', 'Chake1', 'Eatbig-getbig', 'Chake1', 'polyparadigm', 'Shiboleth17', 'Positron311']","[""/u/Chake1 (OP) has awarded 6 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""In the following I will limit my discussion to Heterosexual Cisgendered people only so I don't have to get into the weeds on evolutionary niche sexual strategies and how they evolved.\nLong healthy hair is an indicator of youth and fertility.  All Female beauty standards are meant to signal youth and fertility since the male sexuality evolved to find fertile young  fertile women attractive.  The biological function of Sex is to produce children, and all genes within the human body evolved because every single one of your ancestors survived to adulthood and successfully reproduced.  Child bearing age Healthy Fertile women are the only women that can have children.  Makeup, clothing, hair, plastic surgery, etc all try to make women look younger, healthy, and more fertile.  Clothes accentuate curves of the hips.  A .7 hip to waist ratio has been the one female beauty ideal consistent across both history an cultures.  This is because a .7 human hip to waste ratio is the widest a woman's hips and physically be and still be able to walk.  Wide hips evolved as human brain size increased.\nWomen selected males for higher intelligence, and Males selected women for fertility.  In humans our brains or sort of like Peacock Feathers.  A peacocks Feathers grew huge not because of any survival function, but as a signal for healthy genes.  If a male Peacock was able to survive with such huge feathers without getting eaten, that is a signal the male is strong and has good genes, then the female peacocks will all mate with him.  The same goes for the human brain.  Males with the highest levels of intelligence and strength were the leaders of human tribes, and the high status big brained tribal leaders got to sleep with all of the women while the lower males on the totem pole didn't.  This changed after the invention of agriculture since human survival and reproduction strategy shifted from hunter gatherer bands to agrarian towns and cities, however this is very recent and human sexuality evolved for hundreds of millions of years in the hunter gatherer society. This is why modern sexual monogamy norms had to be enforced via marriage and laws instead of people being monogamous without socially constructed artificial incentives and punishments.  Some primates are naturally monogamous, humans aren't and nether are our closes primate relatives, Chimpanzees, and Bonobos.\nLong story short long healthy hair is a female fertility indicator, which is why most men find it attractive, and the vast majority of human cultures throughout history had beauty standards with long hair in women.  Male fashion standards vary much more widely culture to culture since Female sexuality didn't evolve to reproduce with the male that is the most fertile, but rather whoever was the highest status and wealth which is a signal for good genes and high intelligence.  A high status male has genes that will ensure their sons are also high status males who have a better chance at reproducing.  Different cultures and sub cultures have different fashion for men representing status.  For some it is long hair and a beard, for others it is short hair in a suit, who can fit the most bones through their nose, decking themselves out in gold jewelry and Air Jordan's, wearing a flashy pimp suit with a cane covered in diamonds, etc.  However for women, the beauty signals nearly 100% geared toward trying to look young, healthy, and fertile and long hair is simply one of many ways of doing that.  Typically there are mostly 3 kinds of women who have short hair, Feminists, Old Ladies, and Lesbians who are deliberately not trying to get male attention.\n"", ""If I'm understanding your argument correctly, the reason why women have long hair is because it is seen as being for youth and fertility. However, this doesn't really address the male components of attraction. With the current argument, it should be that men are of any sort of length of hair and women are longer haired because that is a sign of beauty. This isn't the case in society, though, as male hair norms are shorter hair.\n"", 'What you have to look at is what does hair length signal in your social context.  In the modern context long hair on men signals to most people as low status, unprofessional, homeless looking, too poor to afford a hair cut, probably doesn’t make allot of money.  You don’t see any Presidents, Politicians, CEOs, and other high status males in positions of power with long hair. Therefore long hair isn’t masculine because it signals low status and bad genes.\nIf you were a Viking Warrior 1000 years ago long hair and a long beard did signal high status.

All Female beauty standards are meant to signal youth and fertility since the male sexuality evolved to find fertile young  fertile women attractive.  The biological function of Sex is to produce children, and all genes within the human body evolved because every single one of your ancestors survived to adulthood and successfully reproduced.  Child bearing age Healthy Fertile women are the only women that can have children.  Makeup, clothing, hair, plastic surgery, etc all try to make women look younger, healthy, and more fertile.  Clothes accentuate curves of the hips.  A .7 hip to waist ratio has been the one female beauty ideal consistent across both history an cultures.  This is because a .7 human hip to waste ratio is the widest a woman's hips and physically be and still be able to walk.  Wide hips evolved as human brain size increased.\nWomen selected males for higher intelligence, and Males selected women for fertility.  In humans our brains or sort of like Peacock Feathers.  A peacocks Feathers grew huge not because of any survival function, but as a signal for healthy genes.  If a male Peacock was able to survive with such huge feathers without getting eaten, that is a signal the male is strong and has good genes, then the female peacocks will all mate with him.  The same goes for the human brain.  Males with the highest levels of intelligence and strength were the leaders of human tribes, and the high status big brained tribal leaders got to sleep with all of the women while the lower males on the totem pole didn't.  This changed after the invention of agriculture since human survival and reproduction strategy shifted from hunter gatherer bands to agrarian towns and cities, however this is very recent and human sexuality evolved for hundreds of millions of years in the hunter gatherer society. This is why modern sexual monogamy norms had to be enforced via marriage and laws instead of people being monogamous without socially constructed artificial incentives and punishments.  Some primates are naturally monogamous, humans aren't and nether are our closes primate relatives, Chimpanzees, and Bonobos.\nLong story short long healthy hair is a female fertility indicator, which is why most men find it attractive, and the vast majority of human cultures throughout history had beauty standards with long hair in women.  Male fashion standards vary much more widely culture to culture since Female sexuality didn't evolve to reproduce with the male that is the most fertile, but rather whoever was the highest status and wealth which is a signal for good genes and high intelligence.  A high status male has genes that will ensure their sons are also high status males who have a better chance at reproducing.  Different cultures and sub cultures have different fashion for men representing status.  For some it is long hair and a beard, for others it is short hair in a suit, who can fit the most bones through their nose, decking themselves out in gold jewelry and Air Jordan's, wearing a flashy pimp suit with a cane covered in diamonds, etc.  However for women, the beauty signals nearly 100% geared toward trying to look young, healthy, and fertile and long hair is simply one of many ways of doing that.  Typically there are mostly 3 kinds of women who have short hair, Feminists, Old Ladies, and Lesbians who are deliberately not trying to get male attention.\n""]",62.48,"[[76.72, 57.0, 68.81, 77.16, 48.47, 57.43, 64.91, 47.79, 63.02, 85.69, 63.19, 69.41, 66.23, 58.32, 57.3, 57.47, 69.11, 66.74, 64.38, 66.41, 82.81, 71.04, 68.3, 81.93, 64.71, 48.97, 77.64, 92.83, 106.97, 74.35, 81.93, 71.14, 74.35, 77.16, 78.99, 84.17, 89.08, 72.16, 63.63, 73.51, 65.89, 70.43, 65.73, 73.85, 112.09, 46.58, 96.08, 104.64], [76.72, 57.0, 68.81, 77.16, 48.47, 57.43, 64.91, 47.79, 63.02, 85.69, 63.19, 69.41, 66.23, 58.32, 57.3, 57.47, 69.11, 66.74, 64.38, 66.41, 82.81, 71.04, 68.3, 81.93, 64.71, 48.97, 77.64, 92.83, 106.97, 74.35, 81.93, 71.14, 74.35, 77.16, 78.99, 84.17, 89.08, 72.16, 63.63, 73.51, 65.89, 70.43, 65.73, 73.85, 112.09, 46.58, 96.08, 104.64], [76.72, 57.0, 68.81, 77.16, 48.47, 57.43, 64.91, 47.79, 63.02, 85.69, 63.19, 69.41, 66.23, 58.32, 57.3, 57.47, 69.11, 66.74, 64.38, 66.41, 82.81, 71.04, 68.3, 81.93, 64.71, 48.97, 77.64, 92.83, 106.97, 74.35, 81.93, 71.14, 74.35, 77.16, 78.99, 84.17, 89.08, 72.16, 63.63, 73.51, 65.89, 70.43, 65.73, 73.85, 112.09, 46.58, 96.08, 104.64], [76.72, 57.0, 68.81, 77.16, 48.47, 57.43, 64.91, 47.79, 63.02, 85.69, 63.19, 69.41, 66.23, 58.32, 57.3, 57.47, 69.11, 66.74, 64.38, 66.41, 82.81, 71.04, 68.3, 81.93, 64.71, 48.97, 77.64, 92.83, 106.97, 74.35, 81.93, 71.14, 74.35, 77.16, 78.99, 84.17, 89.08, 72.16, 63.63, 73.51, 65.89, 70.43, 65.73, 73.85, 112.09, 46.58, 96.08, 104.64], [76.72, 57.0, 68.81, 77.16, 48.47, 57.43, 64.91, 47.79, 63.02, 85.69, 63.19, 69.41, 66.23, 58.32, 57.3, 57.47, 69.11, 66.74, 64.38, 66.41, 82.81, 71.04, 68.3, 81.93, 64.71, 48.97, 77.64, 92.83, 106.97, 74.35, 81.93, 71.14, 74.35, 77.16, 78.99, 84.17, 89.08, 72.16, 63.63, 73.51, 65.89, 70.43, 65.73, 73.85, 112.09, 46.58, 96.08, 104.64], [76.72, 57.0, 68.81, 77.16, 48.47, 57.43, 64.91, 47.79, 63.02, 85.69, 63.19, 69.41, 66.23, 58.32, 57.3, 57.47, 69.11, 66.74, 64.38, 66.41, 82.81, 71.04, 68.3, 81.93, 64.71, 48.97, 77.64, 92.83, 106.97, 74.35, 81.93, 71.14, 74.35, 77.16, 78.99, 84.17, 89.08, 72.16, 63.63, 73.51, 65.89, 70.43, 65.73, 73.85, 112.09, 46.58, 96.08, 104.64]]"
16,GnosticGnome,"Of course many onesies cut costs with snaps, but the nicer ones are zip-up which saves valuable time fumbling under the night light at 3AM.  But a zipper can have the fully zipped zipper rest at the leg or the neck.  Most seem to choose the neck, with two problems.  First, it must be covered by a flap/snap at the neck to prevent the zipper from irritating baby's chin.  Second and more importantly, most of the baby must be uncovered to check or change a diaper.  If the zipper rests at the leg, different story.  One can unzip to the waist to check, avoiding waking up the baby.  There is also slight less disturbance/crying for a change, but less significant than for a check.  Anyway, I think this outweighs any possible benefits from the more common neck resting zipper.

History of mental illness and drugs: Those who have a history of substance abuse should be disallowed from having children. Criminal history: Those with certain criminal histories should be barred from procreating. E.g. Sexual violence. Genetic defects: E.g. mental retardation.

Whereas the hereditarily healthy families have for the most part adopted a policy of having only one or two children, countless numbers of inferiors and those suffering from hereditary conditions are reproducing unrestrainedly while their sick and asocial offspring burden the community.\nSome scientists and physicians opposed the involuntary aspect of the law while others pointed to possible flaws. But the designation of specific conditions as inherited, and the desire to eliminate such illnesses or handicaps from the population, generally reflected the scientific and medical thinking of the day in Germany and elsewhere.\nNazi Germany was not the first or only country to sterilize people considered ""abnormal."" Before Hitler, the United States led the world in forced sterilizations. Between 1907 and 1939, more than 30,000 people in twenty-nine states were sterilized, many of them unknowingly or against their will, while they were incarcerated in prisons or institutions for the mentally ill. Nearly half the operations were carried out in California. Advocates of sterilization policies in both Germany and the United States were influenced by eugenics. This sociobiological theory took Charles Darwin\'s principle of natural selection and applied it to society. Eugenicists believed the human race could be improved by controlled breeding.\n\n', ""The state already has the power to influence people's income levels, which themselves are correlated with race and mental illness and criminal history and genetic defects. Someone could come into power that wants to enact policy that will target whichever group(s) in a way that makes those groups not achieve the litmuses you've proposed. It would also be trivial for the state to morph the litmuses in incredibly insidious ways.\n"", '\nThe state already has the power to influence people\'s income levels, which themselves are correlated with race and mental illness and criminal history and genetic defects. \n\nI\'m confused by your use of the word ""themselves"". \n\nSomeone could come into power that wants to enact policy that will target whichever group(s) in a way that makes those groups not achieve the litmuses you\'ve proposed.\n\nWhat is a litmus? \nAlso, you seem to have no evidence for this claim at all.

When I moved back to America, I found that some people were saying ""nani?"" Instead of what because they heard it in anime. It is true that the word nani is kinda like what, but it is usually said only in context, like o name wa nani desu? (What is your name) But, you do not have the right to say Japanese words.out of context just because they say it in an anime. The Japanese are a very nice culture, and need to be respected. If you don't speak the language, or have a physical tie to the place (ie. Lived there, family there ect.) It is just plain rude to use the language out of context. instead, a better word to use would be excuse me?? Or sumimassen . Like really, have some respect for cultures. Note: this is not an attack on the people who watch anime, but the ones who say nani out of context.

But even that is wrong as there are no uniform two sides with undecided people (independents, moderates, centrists, whatever) but two loose coalitions of diverse voting blocs.\nCompare it with Europe where you can have three socialist parties, two liberal parties, a conservative (christian democrat) party and a popular/agrarian party in a parliament and that will still not include half of the parties that did not cross the voting threshold.  \nThe people in Europe are not different from America. It is only that your political establishment lies to you and brainwashes you into believing a complete fabrication that benefits said establishment.\nIt is the main reason why America is such a highly divided place.  There is so much of this warped understanding of American politics, far more even than in Britain from where the traditions originated. In Britain you can be a ""tory"" which means a conservative but that is mostly traditional since you can also be a liberal and vote for the Tories. You can be liberal and vote for Liberal Democrats and you can be liberal and vote for Labour although it was traditionally a socialist party. In fact in 20th century Britain become more European/Continental in its political tradition while America kept the old Tory/Whig duopoly that only evolves through consecutive party systems.\nIn short. It is wrong and pathological and it is as close to a genuine ""conspiracy"" as you can get in politics. It is a conspiracy of both parties to maintain the status quo which benefits them and it includes the Republicans as well as the Democrats who ruled the US for over 50 years from 1932 to 1996. Democrats controlled the Congress for 60 years, the Senate for 50 years of senate, and the President for 34 years. Don\'t let the reddit Democrat-sponsored hivemind tell you that it is just your party that is at fault. In fact it is only very recently that they can be really blamed for anything since even during the ""evil Reagan"" era Dems controlled the House.\nThis is a very toxic view of the world that leads to serious issues and unnecessary politicization of everyday life since it ties political party allegiance or a ""team"" to any of your ideological decisions. This is how the parties like it because it keeps you artificially divided whether along those lines or along race, sex, religion whatever.\nConsider feminism - it really shows how this dynamic works in larger sphere of public discourse in America. \nIn Europe it is a sub-section of ""women\'s movements"" and - especially in the former Soviet bloc - a highly irrelevant and generally shunned one. Since women\'s rights were in various countries promoted by socialist (various strands and parties!) and liberal (less conservative) factions and there is a high disconnect between party and ideology then feminism is perceived as one of many ways of approaching the issue. There are feminists but they mostly exist within larger political structures in mainstream left and in particular in fringe radical parties  on the far left. In America however feminism managed to establish itself as the women\'s advocacy in general public discourse since it is the most overtly political of ideologies concerning gender and Democrats being a huge political blob of ""everyone who is not Republican"" became their playground.\nSee election in 2012, 2016 and currently for results.\nAnd you could go on and point to other similar developments where a small group of highly organized ideologues managed to hijack a broad group of potential supporters. It\'s almost like a marketing/sales approach where you Xerox a document, Google information, Skype friends, Facebook that chick from maths class and Fedex your broken laptop.\nOr alternatively it\'s just like Christianity claiming the moral monopoly i.e. why it is harder to be elected President in America if you are an ethical white male successful businessman and atheist, compared to a crooked black lesbian Muslim trans advocate and former prostitute.\n', 'I\'m not sure where  the actual problem is, to be honest. I get that people generally old a plurality of views and that their beliefs do not generally align with the party 110%. I recognize that and don\'t think it\'s necessarily productive to ascribe all republicans beliefs to you. There\'s no real point in doing that.\nYet, whether you disagree with some ""republican values"" or buy them wholesale, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn\'t amount to much of a difference because you still support the whole. It\'s not like you can grade your vote. \n', ""If you tell me you are a Republican, I immediately know that you either agree with, or don't care, about the following issues (for a few examples):\n\nTrump's horrific immorality and corruption\nCynical use of religion to further political goals\nGOP enablement/lack of congressional oversight\nVoter suppression, e.g. Georgia this year\nConstraining LGBTQ rights\nBlatant racism from politicians.\n\n.\nPoint is, you have aligned yourself with a group that has a cynical and destructive worldview.\nCentrist is hard to describe these days because Republicans have successfully moved the Overton window so far to the right that a Centrist today would just be a Reagan Republican 30 years ago.\n"", 'What is your need to associate closely with Republicans and call yourself one if you disagree with them?\n', ""I'll bite.\nPeople shouldn't stop assuming that someone believes all party beliefs. \nFirstly, the binary system we have now allows us to set a reasonable expectation of who someone is on the aggregate. \nGeneralizing is how people are and it's human nature to group things together. You're never going to be able to deprogram our entire evolutionary history. \nSo if we establish that most people who self identify as left or right usually share a plurality of those views then there isn't any reason not to assume they have most of those common left/right views. It's a completely reasonable assumption to make. \nNow here's why this a bad thing. It's perfectly fine to internally assume that if someone says they're republican you then start internally running down the list in your mind of what they're most likely to think. The problem with this is that more often than not, the majority of people care far more about their opinions and being right than they do about cooperation and finding common ground with people with opposing viewpoints. \nSo ultimately what ends up happening is, I tell someone I'm a conservative, they tell me I'm a Nazi and then they never make it past that first snap judgement to ask me why. They just assume that they have all the information they need to make a value judgement against my character which neither broadens their horizons or let's them see me as a person and not some fictitious villain.\nThe problem is not that someone is assuming you toe the party lines on all issues; the issue is that they can't look past that to see you as an individual. \n"", ""If you don't believe in one of their main things, then no you aren't a Republican. It makes no sense. It's like saying you are a KKK member but you like Jews.\n"", 'That’s why instead of using parties like Republicans and Democrats, it’s easier to use labels like centrist, social liberal, fiscal conservative, social conservative, alt right, libertarian etc. \nThat to me is more accurate in terms of understanding someone’s viewpoint. Within liberals and conservatives there are multiple factions. \n', 'But the thing is that typically is the case. People like for things to be simple and often don’t want to have to have an internal debate about everything they believe. It’s easier to pick the side that you like, think is right, and generally agree with and then accept the party line when it comes to the issues even if you thought about it you might not fully agree. Plus disagreeing with the party line puts you at odds with the mob or the tribe and most people don’t want that so they go along to get along.\nPlus, people typically listen to media outlets for their “side”. This further entrenches them by hearing their side’s talking points and platitudes repeated over and over so they have mantras to use as a weapon against their own contradictory thoughts. The party line is this easier to toe.\nThis is why it’s not surprising that when you ask one person on one “side” politically about the issues you can generally predict almost everything they believe/agree with. It’s rare to talk to a republican who isn’t pro-life, anti-gun control, anti-immigration, pro-tax cuts, anti-socialized healthcare and education, anti-welfare, anti-climate change (doesn’t believe it exists), and anti-marijuana legalization. It’s rare to talk to a Democrat who isn’t pro-choice, pro-gun control, pro-immigration, anti-corporate welfare, pro-socialized healthcare and education (to differing extents albeit), pro-welfare, pro-climate change(believes it exists), and pro marijuana-legalization. If a Republican or Democrat said aloud, amongst people who are on their side politically, that they vehemently disagree with one of those points they’d probably have a serious argument on their hands that might end in name-calling.\nI say all that to say this: to an extent you’re right that your party persuasion doesn’t determine everything about you but it definitely is a great predictor or what you believe. Now should people judge your character based on the belief? I think it depends on the belief itself and why you hold that belief. If you opposed welfare because you believed poor people are a drain on the country and deserve to be left to die, I’d probably conclude that you’re a shitty person. If you opposed it because you thought there was a better way to help people, I’d acknowledge that we may have a difference of opinion but I wouldn’t judge you as a person in a negative light.\n', '""As long as it doesn\'t hinder my rights""...I\'ve met other Republicans who will say this same thing and I\'m genuinely curious WHY you believe that someone gaining rights would somehow affect yours? Can you give any example in history where that has happened? It\'s a mind-boggling statement. \n', ""I am an independent progressive. I've watched the Democratic party bash progressives for years while paying lip service to social issues and being center to center-right on foreign policy, Wall Street regulations, and especially on issues regarding all the money swirling around Congress. The hot topic right now is how radical mainstream Democrats are and how scary and new that is. Mainstream Democrats have been moving to the right for decades to appeal to moderates and to pad their pocketbooks, and only recently have started to shift back left when they finally started to realize the were losing more of their base than was being gained in new moderate voters. This isn't new, it's a return to a compromise second approach rather than compromise first, and is more aligned with the largest portions of their base. \nMy point is, I'm still an independent progressive. I could have called myself a member of the Democratic party the whole time and been more right than wrong on sheer percentage. Hell, I'm probably 70-80% aligned at this point in the shift, at least with the rhetoric, and that's pretty damn high. But I'm not choosing a team, I'm not leaving myself open to be burned by another tactical shift, and most importantly I'm not raising money for the DNC to hoard it away or pay it out to candidates the people don't want. No, I will vote based on the policies that the men and women running align themselves with, and when that means I'm voting Republican (very rare, best example I have is the mayor of my town after years of a corrupt Democrat) or independent or third party (unless it's the general election for president, I'm not interested in lighting that particular vote on fire) so be it. \nYou should figure out what's important to you and define yourself by that. Your party isn't interested in you beyond your money and your vote. But you'll find individual candidates here and there who will be interested in your values and ideas, and they will fight for them. Don't miss out on that because you're playing for the team.\nEdit: Because I realize my comment can be seen as off topic. I disagree with you because you are the one who has labeled yourself, and the onus is on you to change that. People are justified in their assessment of you as a Republican, because at minimum you are a benign accomplice to all the ideas Republicans espouse. Even if that isn't 100% accurate, nobody sees you fighting the monster from within, debating Republicans on conservatism, fighting Republicans when they are harmful to your sensibilities. They see you as accepting those things and they are justified in that because most of them have no way to see otherwise.\n"", ""Right now you're identifying with the pro-rape, disability mocking, dictator worshipping party that calls journalists enemies of the people.

But I believe that anyone can be married to anyone\n\nHere’s the thing. You don’t believe that anyone can be married to anyone. More specifically you don’t support LGBT marriage. If you did, you wouldn’t be a republican.\nYour political affiliation is your vote, and your vote is your say. You can’t say you believe in gay marriage and then use 100% of your power in the political sphere to prop up a party that opposes it. And not just that the Republican Party oppose extending basic human rights for that class of marginalised people. \nIf you say you are my friend, but then when an opportunity to put your own well-being over mine arises and you choose to ignore my existence for your own well-being than you are only a friend when it is convenient to you.\nSupporting a cause means supporting it.\nThat’s not the same as being a democrat who believes in low corporate taxes. (This is a hypothetical, not saying the democrats support higher corporate taxes and not trying to get into the details of this example) if I believe in low corporate taxes and still vote democrat that’s fine. But if I said “I’m a democrat but support low corporate taxes” you’d rightfully question my moral stance on that issue.\nClearly it’s an issue that doesn’t have priority in my mind. And clearly there other issues that I see as being more important.\nI think the distinction is that there is often disagreement within the democrat part over matters of policy. (As there is with the Republican Party)\nBut there is only one party that doesn’t support the rights of marginalised groups like LGBTQ. And so long as you support that party there is no way you can justify being a person in support of gay marriage.\nHere’s another example.\nLet’s say the democrats were defending slavery. But abe lincoln comes along and wants to abolish slavery. Even if I disagree with ALL the prevailing republican policy of the time, the moral stance is to support the republicans.\nOf course you could NOT support the republicans and say that you just find the rest of their policy too abhorrent or disagreeable... but then can I really claim to oppose slavery? Or attribute that label to myself? Sure maybe on paper, but to what extent do I really oppose it? Are you going to be very convinced if I tell you “well I just don’t like their tax policy but I really support ending slavery!”\nMaybe you’ll differentiate me between a card carrying KKK member sure, but odds are you’re still going to judge me for my priorities and question how much I really support ending slavery.\nSo when someone says they support gay marriage but they are a republican, I’m just a bit skeptical and not all that convinced of your the conviction in your views.\nLet’s say you had a sibling who was gay, would you feel comfortable telling them you support their right to get married but you just align more with republican policy? What if your girl/boy friend was bisexual? What if it was a close friend who was gay?\nYou don’t REALLY support gay marriage you just don’t oppose it.\n', 'My roommate and I have had a similar discussion to this. We were talking in the context of the presidential election. Someone we knew claimed that every person who voted for Trump was racist. My roommate and I both disagreed with this, though in different ways. Essentially what it boiled down to was that you don’t have to believe a certain perspective to support it with your vote.\nVoters vote for people, and not particular issues. Lets say, for example, (I’m not claiming this as true, it’s purely a hypothetical) that Trump’s immigration policies are objectively racist (again, not claiming that’s how it actually is, just using it as an example). Someone can be a strong supporter of a conservative economic agenda and have no racist feelings toward minorities. If that person votes for Trump for his economic policies, that vote supports all of Trump’s platform, and therefore also supports the racist immigration policies. They may not have voted for him because of the immigration policies, but their vote still forwarded that cause. So in this case it isn’t fair to call that person a racist for voting for Trump, but it is fair to say that person’s vote supported racist policies.\nThis is a similar issue. You may not have any negativity towards marriage equality, and it would not be okay to assume you do. But someone could claim that your vote supported the platform that fought against marriage equality, and therefore that your vote still damaged that cause. I think it’s still valid to criticize people for this, but not to assume that is their view.\n', 'Sounds like you\'ve already delta\'d, but to draw further from your example about gay marriage, I guess it depends on what you think is a cornerstone of your belief. Lots of people might be fiscally conservative or believe in minimal government intervention in their lives, but would see the right for everyone to marry as fundamentally important and politically align themselves that way. You\'re right in that no political party or platform is is likely to align perfectly with any one person\'s views; lots of these values are not mutually exclusive across platforms, but there\'s a big difference between ""marry whoever you want so long as it doesn\'t affect me, but I won\'t triumph your right to do so"" and seeing the blocking of that right as something that isn\'t trivial enough to see as a side-issue.\n', ""Maybe this isn't a direct answer to your question, but I've really come to see these political categories as the single most destructive force in current political discourse.

If we could just start talking to each other in a more neutral language and listen to the reasons and feelings we have different takes on our countries' political trajectories instead of getting stuck at the superficial level of policy disagreement then maybe we will be able to move the dialogue forward in a more sympathetic and productive way. \nAll to say I think the binary political categories your question centers around are a big problem everywhere right now, and the more we can do to start breaking them down the better off we will be.  \n\u200b\n\u200b\n"", '\nWhat we really need for America to succeed in the real world, is to enforce a simple and elegant law that holds a president accountable for everything that he/she has said during his/her run as a candidate.\n\n\u200b\nHere is where I had come to this conclusion:\nOne rotten apple, will spoil the bunch.

They become, in essence, conspiracy theorists, that could be directly associated with their political party. They vote for not who is actually right, but for whoever is the one who will solve all of their problems, because they were told that ""Their problems are outside your control.""\nThis is why politicians who do not fulfill their campaign promises keep on being re-elected.

This means I usually vote democrat, but not every democratic politician is trustworthy. Politics is a game that rewards good acting skills so I don’t take emotional slogans like “hope” very seriously. The country needs pragmatic, level-headed solutions to wealth disparity, climate change, prison, healthcare, and education reform. The problem with free market toting republicans is that they are unwittingly defending giant banks and corporations who are actively funneling money from the poor to the rich and destroying the environment. A free market means anyone can start a business and succeed if they work hard and provide a good service. Republican politicians defend corporate monopolies.

So when you identify as a particular ideology, you\'ll automatically open yourself up to all kinds of interpretation that isn\'t under your control. You cannot control the general message of feminism, you cannot control what other feminists say about feminism, you cannot control how others view feminism.

20,svenson_26,"I'll start by saying that I believe password strength is very important, and that users should try to have strong, unique passwords.   When websites force restrictions on passwords, they are reducing security.
By forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters.
By forcing a password to contain numbers and/or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and/or special characters.
The result is there are less possible passwords for a ""hacker"" to choose from if they are trying to randomly guess. Furthermore, there are patterns hackers can follow. Most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. They replace certain letters with numbers/sp chars, or they add the numbers/sp chars to the end.  When passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. As someone who has worked in IT, I can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. People write down passwords when they can't remember them. It makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as ""letmein"". When users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. This reduces overall security, because if any of those things I just mentioned are hacked, then a ""hacker"" can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password.   For example, if I can see that their account recovery question is ""What was my mother's maiden name?"", then that is almost certainly easier to guess than it would be to guess their password. The overall security is reduced. Instead of forcing password restrictions, users should have the freedom to choose a password as ""strong"" or as ""weak"" as they wish. Inform the users when they are making their account how strong their passwords are, and give recommendations. They should also inform users not to use the same password for multiple websites, and to update their passwords often. But at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion. CMV!This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

A PC today can do an order of magnitude of 230 operations per second, meaning that if it can try a password in ~100 operations, it\'ll take around a PC-year to crack, which is reasonably long. If you remove one character, that becomes 64x less, i.e, a PC-week.\nIn reality, the entropy of passwords is probably much smaller because people tend to use actual words and combinations they remember, but someone trying to crack it without a smart system that takes that into account has to pay the full 48 bits and probably more.\n', ""There is always a more secure password.\nWhy stop at 10 when you can make it 11,why stop at 11 when you can make it 15...\nYes the rules are not perfect and can even encourage bad behavior (such as predictable patterns) and are out of date (you probably shouldn't have a password under 16 characters these days) but two important elements of creating a good password are there.

Ultimately its just not feasible in business sense. \nFor reference, this is what GDPR says:\n\nTaking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:\n\n"", '\nBy forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters.\nBy forcing a password to contain numbers and/or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and/or special characters.\n\nSuppose you host a website in which members must create a password for their accounts. Each member can only create a password that a. contains numbers, b. is 1, 2, or 3 characters long, and c. does not start with ""0"", ""00"", or ""000"". These limitations exist so that the math is less complicated. Basically, members can use any number from 1 to 999 as their password. We will also assume that accounts will become locked after 5 failed attempts to sign in.\nIt seems as though any hacker will only have a 5 in 999 chance of guessing any user\'s password. However, it is likely that some members only used a 1 digit password (to simulate people who use overly short and simple passwords). So instead of trying to guess 5 of every possible password, the hacker only guesses 5 of the 9 possible single digit passwords.\nOn our website, 3 members are using a single digit password, 3 members are using a two digit password, and 4 members are using a three digit password. The three members using the single digit password now have a 5 in 9 chance of getting hacked!\nAfter two members on the site complain about being hacked, you decide that all members must now use 3 digit passwords. This means members must pick a number from 100 to 999.\nNow, all 10 users have 3 digit passwords. The hacker can no longer take advantage of people with weak passwords and is forced to tackle 3 digits. Now, everyone only has a 5 in 900 chance of getting hacked.\nEven though we went from 999 possible passwords to 900 possible passwords, everyone is more secure as a whole!\nOf course this example is overly simplified, but I hope it demonstrates why it\'s better to limit the number of possible passwords to prevent hackers from targeting those with weaker passwords.\nWith that said, I do agree with some of your other points regarding complex passwords. Forcing people to make complex passwords often leads to cliches as you\'ve mentioned before. However, your argument that there are less possible passwords when you implement limits is not a valid argument because hackers will only focus on those with weak passwords.\n', 'Surely there should be SOME limit.  Are you really going to build out your system to allow people to use passwords that are 100,000,000 characters long just so you have no limits?\n\nBy forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters.\nThe result is there are less possible passwords for a ""hacker"" to choose from if they are trying to randomly guess. \n\nSure, but less possible by a completely insignificant amount that is more than made up for by the additional security.\nSuppose we just talk about passwords that use 100 different characters that you\'re trying to break by guessing the password.  The number of 8 digit characters is the same as the number of 9 digit characters that start with F.  Like, if I said, ""You can\'t start your password with a capital F"" is that really a restriction that you\'d consider a meaningful reduction?  And the benefit is you get rid of all the passwords that would be practically instantly crackable if the database gets leaked.\n\nMost people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. They replace certain letters with numbers/sp chars, or they add the numbers/sp chars to the end.\n\nWhile I agree that forcing numbers often leads to a ""1!"" at the start or a ""!1"" end or a ""123"" or a ""999"", there are still a lot of varieties that are typically used and it adds security.\n\nWhen users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account.\n\nAre you saying we could get rid of those systems if we had easier password restrictions? No, we\'d still need those exact same systems.  You\'d just have people walking around with 3 character passwords that aren\'t offering them much in the way of protection.\n', '\nSurely there should be SOME limit. Are you really going to build out your system to allow people to use passwords that are 100,000,000 characters long just so you have no limits?\n\nThat\'s a good point. I should have specified that there obviously has to be some limit.   Δ  \n\nis that really a restriction that you\'d consider a meaningful reduction?   \n\nYes. It is. It eliminates 1% of all possible passwords, aka 1008 passwords, aka 10 quadrillion passwords. That is a significant chunk.\nIf you consider all <9 digit passwords ""instantly crackable"", so you might as well eliminate them, then consider this:  It would take exactly the same time to guess all passwords that started with a 1. You even mentioned yourself, that passwords often start with a 1. By the same logic, all these passwords are now ""instantly crackable"", because that is logically where a password guessing algorithm would start.\nObviously, if you kept going making further restrictions such as banning leading ones, then you will be reducing the pool of possible passwords.\n', '\nYes. It is. It eliminates 1% of all possible passwords, aka 1008 passwords, aka 10 quadrillion passwords. That is a significant chunk.\n\nI don\'t see how that is significant to anyone.  For people that already use strong passwords it is irrelevant because they are already using 12+ characters, so removing the passwords with 8 or fewer characters is only going to be just as restrictive as saying, ""You can\'t start your password with these exact 4 characters in this exact order: SVEN"".  That is meaninglessly restrictive.  Next you\'re going to tell me that the restriction, ""Your password can\'t be the same as your username"" adds insecurity because it narrows down the amount of possible passwords.\nIt only removes 1% of the passwords in the case where you\'re using the bare minimum character length.  And even if it did remove 1% of the password space for people using 12+ characters (which it doesn\'t), having a proper password it isn\'t going to matter if it takes 10,000 years to crack or 9,900 years to crack, that is an uncrackable password in either case.\nFor people that want to use shorter passwords it\'s going to vastly increase their security.  So yes, you\'re sacraficing 1% of the brute force security for people using the bare minimum length but that forces others to use a pool of passwords that is 100 or 100x100 or 100x100x100 times larger.\n', ""\nYes.

While there are few ways people generally will handle a non-alpha character requirement, it still opens up the password possibilities in a mathematically-significant way.\nMost ""hacking"" takes place in one of two ways.  Either someone doesn\'t log into their workstation when they walk away (which doesn\'t require a password to do) or it\'s done remotely through a network, in which case sticky notes at a desk don\'t make much of a difference.\n\nI agree that account recovery questions today are incredibly stupid; if you\'ve friended someone on Facebook, you probably know all the answers to the standard account recovery questions.  However, there is no reason why those must be the account recovery questions if you allow for complex passwords.  Instead, I believe there should be a system that allows users to write their own account recovery questions with the note that they should not be questions where the question can be looked up (e.g. ""what\'s my favorite movie quote?"", ""what was the first thing I said to my spouse?"", ""Where did I first try gelato?"").\n', ""\nwhat's my favorite movie quote\n\nThe problem with questions is that non factual information such as opinions (eg. favourite movie quote) are subject to change, and factual information can often be easily found out by simply asking the person.

Modern CPUs can’t crunch that many passwords in a reasonable amount of time. Reducing the requirements makes it a lot easier to hack into.\nAs for the physical methods, those are assuming that the hacker has access to the physical locations.

Are you really going to build out your system to allow people to use passwords that are 100,000,000 characters long just so you have no limits?\n\nBy forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters.\nThe result is there are less possible passwords for a ""hacker"" to choose from if they are trying to randomly guess. \n\nSure, but less possible by a completely insignificant amount that is more than made up for by the additional security.\nSuppose we just talk about passwords that use 100 different characters that you\'re trying to break by guessing the password.  The number of 8 digit characters is the same as the number of 9 digit characters that start with F.  Like, if I said, ""You can\'t start your password with a capital F"" is that really a restriction that you\'d consider a meaningful reduction?  And the benefit is you get rid of all the passwords that would be practically instantly crackable if the database gets leaked.\n\nMost people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. They replace certain letters with numbers/sp chars, or they add the numbers/sp chars to the end.\n\nWhile I agree that forcing numbers often leads to a ""1!"" at the start or a ""!1"" end or a ""123"" or a ""999"", there are still a lot of varieties that are typically used and it adds security.\n\nWhen users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account.\n\nAre you saying we could get rid of those systems if we had easier password restrictions? No, we\'d still need those exact same systems.  You\'d just have people walking around with 3 character passwords that aren\'t offering them much in the way of protection.\n', 'As someone who works in IT, you should know the common methods for obtaining passwords. Using brute force is one of the more common methods, and passwords with less characters are a lot easier to guess than with more. Using 8 characters as a minimum with special characters and capital letters gives 958 possible passwords. That’s over 6.6 quadrillion possibilities. (6 with fifteen 0s). Modern CPUs can’t crunch that many passwords in a reasonable amount of time. Reducing the requirements makes it a lot easier to hack into.\nAs for the physical methods, those are assuming that the hacker has access to the physical locations. In those cases there is usually some sort of physical security to the location to prevent it. (Not always) but in that case, it doesn’t matter how easy or complicated the password is.\nForgetting the password and using password recovery is always a method that can be breached. Which is why more websites are using 2 factor authentication instead, where they send a text message instead of email.\nFinally, it is not the website’s responsibility to ensure that users keep their password stored or remembered. It’s their responsibility to make sure that their website is secured, and provide a method for users to recover it. So enforcing higher security for passwords is the most they can do.\n']",63.49,"[[76.72, 59.19, 75.71, 65.42, 63.39, 93.44, 74.9, 67.86, 48.4, 66.94, 67.89, 92.63, 80.82, 58.79, 50.7, 54.93, 67.99, 78.08, 66.44, 46.78, 70.43, 49.96, 62.98, 62.17, 64.0, 56.39, 75.1, 65.89, 59.33, 60.35, 74.69, 65.83, 72.05, 74.35, 53.61, 35.57, 35.65, 64.41, 57.77, 63.53, 58.96, 63.29, 21.44, 57.1, 73.0, 69.79, 41.36, 61.97, 49.21, 68.44], [76.72, 59.19, 75.71, 65.42, 63.39, 93.44, 74.9, 67.86, 48.4, 66.94, 67.89, 92.63, 80.82, 58.79, 50.7, 54.93, 67.99, 78.08, 66.44, 46.78, 70.43, 49.96, 62.98, 62.17, 64.0, 56.39, 75.1, 65.89, 59.33, 60.35, 74.69, 65.83, 72.05, 74.35, 53.61, 35.57, 35.65, 64.41, 57.77, 63.53, 58.96, 63.29, 21.44, 57.1, 73.0, 69.79, 41.36, 61.97, 49.21, 68.44]]"
21,treesinthestairs,"The furry fandom functions as a fetish community. It is awash in porn and essentially is a fetish. There may well be a social community and non-sexual things that occur, but the interest is sexual in nature. There is nothing wrong with it, per se, but people like teenagers should steer clear until they're able to legally view porn where they reside. It is not a family friendly fandom.Porn:
One could say that other fandoms have sexual aspects and porn, but you are lying to yourself if you think that the furry fandom doesn't revolve around porn in a way that other fandoms do not. Rule 34 is absolutely a thing, but porn is not as central to other fandoms.Let's take Overwatch. Because while there is a ton of porn of it, Overwatch is, predominately, about playing a video game. Porn of Overwatch characters is a minor component and one can definitely like overwatch and have people assume that they look at Overwatch porn.Or what about anime? Anime absolutely has a perverted side, but you can definitely be a fan of anime without people assuming that you are looking at hentai. There are things you can share with other people that they can appreciate on various non-sexual levels.But for the furry fandom? Porn is so central to everything. Pretty much Disney movies, some kemono anime, some cartoon shows, and then... Porn of all that plus OC. There isn't much there that isn't porn. It is virtually impossible to separate yourself from all the porn that is there, which forms the central content most furries like and share a bond with other people over. That's why when one goes to a furry convention, the sales hall is full of porn and more tables sell porn versus a comic con or anime con.You are fooling yourself if you can't see the central place that porn has in the furry community and delusional if you think other interest groups (outside of kink communities) have the same mentality.Conventions:
Conventions are one of those points where you meet people. Conventions have a sense of community and an undertone of various levels of unhealthy sex, from anonymous junk to rape. It is a place where older people often take advantage of people who are lonely, horny, and who don't have a lot of experience with love or sex.Now, is this universal? No. But it is enough to be problematic in a way that other fandoms are not. You don't get this at Comic Con or a Star Trek con or anime con to the same degree. At all. Anime cons would be the closest, but even then it's not on the same level.Other conventions aren't really packed full of the same type of people drawn to the furry fandom. People who feel lonely, isolated, socially inept, horny and who use the furry fandom as an escapist fantasy tend to do more of that at cons than at other conventions. I've been to a bunch. It's not really the same. The amount of sex happening at a con is roughly proportional to the percentage of the sales hall that is devoted to porn and related items. There is an unusual amount of porn being sold at these conventions.Sexuality:
Being part of the furry fandom also fucks with one's sexuality. It will become a secret. It will be something that when they outgrow it hangs around in the background as a source of shame. Explaining it will feel like work and not worth even bringing up. The world will assume the worst. They may also never be rid of the fetish, setting up weird dynamics in the future that would better be avoided for simple ease of life.Moreover, some people will make assumptions about a furry's sexuality in ways that being associated with other fandoms do not. Stating that one likes anime does not mean that people think they have a thing for traps or hentai or catgirls. However, it is common for furries to be associated with people who like their pets a little too much.And some furries know it has enough truth to be problematic for them, if they are honest. Murrsuiters, zoophiles, and pedophiles are definitely at those cons and are part of the community, as much as one might wish them away. The fandom definitely has a problem with these things. They are problematic in a way that hentai is not to the anime fan.If furries go to a convention, they should look for all the non-consensual touching masked as ""pounces"", ""glomping"", etc. Look for pairs of people who aren't of similar ages, but are affectionate (likely unhealthy). Look for collars and think about how that's perceived at the work place. Look for large dogs. Look for people with tattoos of a circle with some type of squiggly line (indicators of a zoophile). Look at the ""normal people"" and decide if that's who they want to be like. How are they perceived by others outside of the fandom? How well adjusted do they seem? People eventually become more like the people they associate with.These are all things that aren't very good. There are hobbies and things that hold big ass conventions that don't feature these things.Fursonas: The function of a fursona is a type of roleplay, where one imagines themselves as a different, usually more perfect, version of them. Having others accept and interact with who they would want to be, uncoupled with the baggage of the real world and the immediacy of interacting with people in real time creates an illusion of a better community than it actually is. Adopting a fursona of what they would want to be allows them to feel empowered.A fursona it is a comforting lie. It's not real. It's a way of coping, but isn't addressing the cause.And that's pretty much all I have. So in conclusion, the furry fandom is a massive sex community that unhealthily revolves around porn and sex, unlike other fandoms and communities out there, and this is why I dislike them.Go ahead, feel free to refute my claims, I'm open.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

You don\'t have people hooking up and having sex at a comic Con.\n\nNow the one crucial word in all of this is ""unhealthily"" revolves around sex and kink to which I have to ask what this community would have to do in order to healthily revolve around sex and kink? \n\nThey would have to keep it on the down-low, abolish beastiality, zoophilia, and pedophilia, they would have to keep the porn and sex behind closed doors and not let minors into the sexual parts of the community, and they would have to center around just the concept of anthropomorphic animals instead of centering around the porn and sex of said anthropomorphic animals, to not let porn be as influential as it is right now.\n', 'I can\'t really help you with the downplaying aspect since, as an outsider myself, I\'ve only ever seen it as a predominantly sex/fetish community and that seems to be the overwhelming impression in the general public, so that\'s where I\'m coming from.\n\nYou don\'t have porn being sold at a Star Trek Con. \n\nI\'ve been to quite a few cons and there\'s definitely R rated art and other content being sold there, not to mention online in every fandom I\'ve ever been a fan of, as well as R (or M, as it\'s called these days) rated fanfiction, and the like. \n\nYou don\'t have people hooking up and having sex at a comic Con. \n\nDo you know this for sure?

22,DoubleDoobie,"Title pretty much explains it all. Dr. McKinnon considers herself female but is still biologically male. I have no issue with Transgenders or those who identify as another gender. However I feel this creates an unfair advantage. While many assert that there are ""no differences between men and women"", this is biologically false. Weight, muscle definition, and testerone all play a factor in her victory. While McKinnon suppresses her testerone, I still am of the opinion that, biologically speaking, she has an advantage. Especially as it relates to muscle mass. More mass = more power = faster cycling.  There's a lot of media out there that clearly has issues with this, so I tried to focus on non-biased sources that tackle this from a medical/scholarly lense.

There was a ton of social pressure on them to accept this change, but they were aware of the possibility this would happen. Their two options are to fight it preemptively (against the current social movement) or just let it happen. If they let it happen there are a few options. Either no trans athletes compete, they compete but don't win, or they win and start crushing dreams and records. In the case of option 3 (which is what we are starting to see) perhaps public opinion will swing back against this policy. In that case the IOC will be able to switch it back without have to deal with the outrage mob.

In fact, even the sports organizations themselves seem to be flying by the seat of their pants, so to speak. As this 2017 review of the literature noted: ""The majority of transgender competitive sport policies that were reviewed were not evidence based."" (Have you ever wondered why the new IAAF policy for women with hyperandroganism is basically restricted to the disciplines in which Caster Semenya competes?)\nThere currently does not seem to be any evidence that transgender women have a systematic competitive advantage in sports (same study), but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, especially if the evidence is so spotty, and the story may be different for individual disciplines, where one specific trait gains outsized importance (such as height in basketball).\nSo, what do we do in the face of uncertainty? This is not a new problem and has affected women with intersex conditions for decades before we even really started to worry about transgender women. The IOC in particular really, really tended to screw over women with intersex conditions, even if there was zero reason to believe that they had a competitive advantage (such as women with CAIS).\nMore recently, the sports courts started to put the onus on sports organizations to prove that the perceived advantage was actually there before implementing policies that may negatively affect the health of athletes and/or be unnecessarily discriminatory (again, that mostly happened in the context of intersex conditions, but much of the rationale could be applied to transgender athletes).\nMoreover, the regular courts have started to get involved, such as in the case of Kristen Worley. Normally, athletes sign away their right to sue before the regular courts and submit themselves to the arbitration of the sports courts, but in the face of the deep corruption that many sports organizations and events suffer (from the FIFA arrests to the Tour de France getting nicknamed Tour de Doping), there is an increasing reluctance in some places to actually let that continue unless the organizations clean up their act.\nThe result is that we have some hastily written policies in place that don\'t really have enough science to back them up. Most seem to focus on keeping testosterone levels low and hoping that this is enough to offset any real or hypothetical advantages that a trans athlete might have. A nasty side effect is that sports organizations seem to be extremely stingy with TUEs (therapeutic use exemptions) for trans women, even where that affects their basic health (because every person, man or woman, needs a minimum level of testosterone for basic functioning). (This was the basis on which Kristen Worley won a settlement.)\nWith that said, much of what you seem to believe about the specific case of McKinnon is based on assumptions that are wrong.\n\nMcKinnon does not suppress testosterone; she is post-op and has endogenous testosterone levels below the normal cis range and that has been the case for years.\nWith the loss of testosterone, you also quickly lose muscle mass. Nobody really argues that trans women (at least post-op) have a competitive advantage when it comes to muscle mass, which disappears rapidly on HRT. Most (real or hypothesized) advantages are believed to be in the long term effects of testosterone and having had a male puberty.\nWeight by itself is not an advantage in cycling (but may be in other disciplines); in fact, the ideal weight is usually in a fairly narrow range depending on your height, slightly different for sprinting and climbing. When people point at the podium picture and think that she has an advantage over her competitors, because she seems to have more bulk ... this isn\'t really how things work in cycling. It\'s even more complicated when it comes to height, especially when you factor in that pro cycling is a team sport.\nThe articles you cite are about the differences between cis men and cis women and only speculate that any male advantages are retained by trans women. But this does not seem to be true for, e.g., hemoglobin levels. HRT does a number on your physiology that goes far beyond just growing breasts. Here is the image of a hand before and after four months of MtF HRT; note how even blood vessels changed over that period. (More on that below.)\n\nThis does not mean that she doesn\'t have an advantage; it means that the situation is inconclusive. And if you look at her entire record, there\'s no evidence of dominance. She\'s won some, but she\'s also placed in the bottom 50% often enough. It\'s consistent with an above average athlete who had a good day. Whether she\'s above average because of effort, because of having had a male puberty, or because of legit genetic differences (remember that sports in large parts is still a genetic lottery) is something that we really cannot tell.\nThe whole situation is hugely complicated:\n\nPost-op trans women generally have lower T levels than cis women, sometimes extremely so. This is because in women both the adrenal glands and the ovaries contribute to testosterone production, and trans women have no ovaries. About 25% of testosterone comes from the adrenal glands, about 25% from the ovaries, the remaining 50% are synthesized from other circulating androgens (which in turn are produced by the adrenal glands and ovaries). Women with an oophorectomy seem to typically experience a drop in 40%-50% of testosterone levels. This is often even more pronounced in adult transitioners, who may require testosterone supplements for basic health.\nPre-op trans women also have their T-levels lowered; however, in their case, we have the problem of policing. What are the effects if a pre-op trans woman goes off anti-androgens for a day every now and then?\nMuscle mass in trans women quickly drops to cis levels on HRT, but the same may not be true for muscle memory.\nHemoglobin levels in trans women seem to be in the cis female range; however, studies are limited and we are not sure if they even are a major factor in performance.\nIt has been speculated that because trans women who have gone through a male puberty have a larger rib cage, they may also have a larger lung capacity and thus VO2max values. However, this has never been really studied and the rare individual assessment of trans women who had their VO2max tested does not seem to back it up.\n\nOn a policy level, there are no easy answers here. We do generally assume that trans women who did not undergo a male puberty do not have a competitive advantage, but even there it becomes difficult to prove that you didn\'t (or that your testosterone was adequately suppressed for the duration). For trans women who did experience male puberty, we just don\'t know enough to make any firm statements one way or the other.\n', ""Do you think anyone who has a biological advantage in a given sport should be disqualified?\nFor example, let's say I was born with a rare condition that allows my lungs to absorb more oxygen than most. This makes me a very effective marathon runner. Should I be disqualified?\n"", ""I appreciate this perspective, but I don't think the argument works because that's not a real medical condition. To be clear, I tried to find some articles to change my view before I posted this. I couldn't find anything, only things supporting my view, but largely from partisan sources. \n"", 'There actually are documented cases where people (through a fluke of genetics) build up lactic acid in their muscle tissue at a much slower rate than a normal person.

To my knowledge, people like Usain Bolt don't have this condition. While I understand your sentiment, they starting winning championships I'd say it's not really comparable. \n"", ""It isn't a condition that is commonly tested for (as it isn't doesn't prohibit people from competing).  There is every possibility that people winning marathons do have this condition, but they don't know it because there is no reason to test.\nSo, to change the question a bit, should we start testing for it?\n"", 'So something I think about when this discussion comes up is a bit I saw about Olympic Swimmer Michael Phelps.\nIt basically measured out his body and proportions and outlined why it gave him a leg up when it came to swimming. He didn\'t have a ""medical condition"" he just had a body that naturally afforded him an advantage (for the record I cannot say if this is a true thing or not, it\'s just what I think about).\nIs it fair for him to swim?\nAnd then of course we run into a much larger question when it comes to athletics. What does it mean to have an ""unfair advantage""? If I was allowed to spend eight hours a day practicing swimming from a young age I\'m going to be better than someone who had to quit and get a job when they were 16 to support their dying mother.\nWhat I am getting at here is we look at athletic competitions as being ideal when they\'re between two completely equal opponents (or teams) but that\'s not how reality shakes out. The New York Yankees can afford to pay more money for the best players, a woman with a smaller frame is better at gymnastics, and on and on.\nI honestly don\'t know how to answer the question about trans people in sports. We developed a lot of our gendered notions about sports before being trans was a mainstream notion that we needed to address. I am not an athlete, I cannot really speak to what is fair or not. All I know is that from an outside perspective it seems that people with ""natural abilities"" are lauded in their athletic professions...so why give trans people shit about it?\nWas it fair that Peyton Manning kept getting to throw footballs? Maybe he should have been forced to play a sport he wasn\'t so naturally gifted at to level the playing field?\nI honestly don\'t know how to approach this topic.

The average height in the WNBA is 6 feet. And the average height in the NBA is 6\'8"". \nShe was actually taller than the average male NBA player. Should she have been banned from the WNBA? \n', ""Here is a study discussing transgender distance runners.\nHere is an article discussing it.\nEssentially, the conclusion of the study is that following a long enough transition period, distance runners did not see a significant advantage from transitioning. People who transitioned had similar age grades both before and after transitioning; that is, if they were a 75th percentile for a male 45 year old runner before transitioning, after two years of transitioning they were a 75th percentile for a female 47 year old runner.\nNow, this study isn't perfect, but it points towards the conclusion that transitioning erases a large portion of the gains from being biologically male. You note that males have advantages in sports, but muscle mass and weight are strongly linked to testosterone levels and there is a ton of anecdotal evidence that you simply cannot maintain pre-transitioning levels of muscle mass while taking anti-androgens (and likewise, you can see a ton of similar evidence for bodybuilders putting on more mass while blasting testosterone at high doses).\nCycling isn't the same as long distance running, but it seems substantially similar enough that I think it's reasonable to assume the effects are the same.\n"", 'I wonder if in this specific event she could be literally weighed and her muscle mass measured against the other women in the race, would she have come out as the one with more muscle and if she did not have more muscle weight than the other women would that make it fair in your opinion? \n', ""This is a little bit “out there” from the current norm, but would you be at all receptive to the idea that there shouldn’t be gendered competitions at all? \nPerhaps MTF competitors merely expose the oddity of having a separate class of competitors whose events, stats and “winners” are kept segregated by anything other than their raw ability.\nIt is well known that there are genetic oddities surrounding gender, including “men” who have fully XX chromosomes. It seems likely that in the long run, any criteria used to segregate men's and women's competitions will ultimately fall to such oddities and those “naturally abnormal” individuals will come to dominate the ranks and records of women’s sports anyway, so excluding transgender people doesn’t protect gender discriminated sports from the same kind of “unfair” competitors in the long run.\n"", ""The question isn't whether she had a biological advantage. As others have pointed out, people within a sex can have advantages over each other which is perfectly fair.\nThe question is, is her biological advantage significant enough. Is she performing at a much higher physical level than women.\nI can't find the study right now, but I remember reading that they found that testosterone suppression over time led to lower performances. Enough that the significant advantage of being male was not there anymore.\nIf hormone therapy is really changing your muscles and your body overall to act more female, then transgender athletes are fine, given they meet the testosterone levels required.\nMy personal take on this issue is that we need to simply remove gender from sports, and base it on levels of performance. \n"", 'Sorry, u/ray07110 – your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1:\n\nDirect responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP’s stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question.

Life is most coherently defined as a homeostatic chemical system which sustains itself through metabolic processes. A fetus is that. Human is the description given to life which contains genetic markers within a reasonable range to be able to be called ""human"". In that way, fetuses are human life.\nThe reason that I am okay with the termination of fetuses is not because they are human life, but because they are not people. Personhood is a philosophical distinction given to entities which labels them as being worthy of certain protections and respect by other entities with personhood. Personhood is a far more nebulous term in regards to anyone in society, because it is emergent from the wildly varying ethical and moral values of individuals in society, so it is a term that, when it has wildly varying definitions between people, should be expected to have wildly varying definitions, precisely because of the varying standards that all people has at to what is worthy of having their life protected and what doesn\'t. Therefore, I feel justified in both asserting my definition while acknowledging that there will be wildly different definitions throughout society. The reason that fetuses are not something that should be defined as people is that all of the entities who exist in society will quite definitively maximize their overall long term preferences if they give themselves the flexibility to terminate fetuses conceived under inconvenient circumstances.\nThe reason that it is bad for society to treat other grown humans this way is that when we reciprocate good behavior towards people, they become better people who are better able to fulfil our interests. Fetuses cannot be affected by our threats to their life in any negative way, so there is nothing to gain by not making the threat to them a widespread public policy. And we gain a lot when we can terminate them when they are inconvenient. We enable women and even men, to a degree, to more easilly pursue things that will make them more skilled effectively people in society. We will actually create opportunities for better people to be born who otherwise could not have been, because a lot of those women who abort would then go on to have babies later that they would not have had if they had one earlier that they had to spend their resources on.\nAs far as violating consent, insofar as fetuses cannot consent to be killed: all life is non-consensual. You are raped through your dads dick and down your mothers fallopian tube, and you are forcefed through your ambilical cord and just generally kidnapped into existence. Is the consequence of this usually enjoyable enough for most people it creates? Sure. But it is still non-consensual. If an irresponsible thrill seeker seeks out a situation in which they are more likely to get raped, they get raped, trying to resist the whole time, but still being overpowered, even if, in their head, they liked that it happened and wanted someone to genuinely overpower and rape them, that person would still have been raped, even if they secretly wanted it. So the consequence does not matter, just the consent, insofar as arguments from consent go. If a lack of consent makes killing a fetus wrong, then the same lack of consent makes procreation wrong, because procreation is non-consensual, which makes abortion morally equivalent to procreation on that argument.\n', ""The reason that people discuss it as being about a womans body is because they're talking about whether or not a womans right to her bodily autonomy beats out the fetus. The pro choice side argues that it does, because every persons bodily autonomy should win.

24,arnoldone,"I think there shouldn't exist any minimum wage laws. This causes companies to legally have a reference for a what is the minimum that all other companies can pay and get away with it. If the minimum wage didn't exist, there would be a struggle for what is the lowest amount that could be paid, and it would be difficult for illegal immigrant work to be paid less than everyone else.I see it as analogous a very large companies price fixing a product. Once they set a price, for example ebooks at 9.99, all other smaller companies have to set the price to the same value knowing that (1) they can't lower it more than that otherwise they loose money (2) they can't increase it knowing that customers will go elsewhere.In the case of work pay, the government sets a price to $15.00. All companies will (1) set the pay to what is legally allowed while maximizing their profit (2) employers have no motivation to increase the wage knowing there will always be another guy that they can pay $15.00 an hour. (3) low skill employees can't move around because of point 1.If no minimum wage was in place (1) no reference is available for employers for wage (2) employers would have to truly find a sweet spot for profitability and keeping  employees (3) low skill employees would have more motivation to move around because something better could be around the corner (4) the lack of a minimum wage would allow businesses to hire more people (most likely for less money) but the pressure of too many jobs being available would exert an upward direction of wages because of point 3.EDIT:
I should say that im not against removing any other social safety nets. In fact I agree that better safety nets should be provided.Also, someone suggested to provide a different solution to minimum wage. A better solution to minimum wages would be a wage ratio requirement.

If the minimum wage would act as a barrier to hiring, then the business would already be out of business because they wouldn't be able to afford the employees they already have (since your first employee costs you less than your tenth due to economies of scale).\n"", ""\nHow could it?

If they can\'t afford them at the mandated minimum wage, then necessarily can\'t afford them at the market rate unless the market rate is lower - which in turn says that wages can\'t rise from competition because if they rose high enough that the market wage went over the mandatory minimum, the business would need to close again.\nIt is IMPOSSIBLE for a mandatory minimum wage to both keep jobs out of the labour market and depress wages through reduced hiring competition. If jobs are kept out of the market because the minimum is too costly, then the minimum market price must be above the competitive market wage; if the competitive market wage is higher than the mandatory minimum then it can\'t be keeping jobs out.\n\n\nThe only reason businesses want to cut or kill minimum wage is so they can pay less.

As I said above, the market forces cannot simultaneously push wages up and also allow businesses that can\'t afford the minimum wage to be able to hire people. \nIn any event, yoir argument here makes no sense. Employees can still negotiate for a higher wage if there\'s a mandatory minimum; removing the minimum will not somehow mean Walmart will pay more than they could otherwise. It\'s a mandatory MINIMUM, not a mandatory MAXIMUM. All removing the minimum does is allow some businesses to pay less, which means wages reduce.\nAs an aside - plenty of startups could get started if they were legally allowed to use slave labour. If there is a moral imperative to allow people to start businesses so we should let them underpay their staff, why shouldn\'t we take that to the logical extreme and say that slavery is okay?

Also the people on minimum wage essentially break even in this scenario bringing them back to trying to raise it again.\n\n3.Smaller businesses get screwed by this. They can not as easily afford to raise their wages because they have a far limited supply of money unlike many of the larger companies.

There is a reason big companies like amazon are supporting a new federal minimum wage.\n\nA large black market of work comes because of minimum wage.

It also leaves workers at risk of unfair treatment because they are doing illegal work and can't exactly go to the government (similar to prostition in america).\n\nFinally you're devaluing the dollar.

Legally, there's no prohibition on wages above minimum wage. Therefore, we know that our wages are not going to go up, or they would already have done that.

But the thing is, those jobs are only viable because they pay below minimum wage. A job shortage created by them can never raise the wages above minimum wage, because then those jobs cease to exist.\n\nI see it as analogous a very large companies price fixing a product. Once they set a price, for example ebooks at 9.99, all other smaller companies have to set the price to the same value knowing that (1) they can't lower it more than that otherwise they loose money (2) they can't increase it knowing that customers will go elsewhere.\n\nThis is not how price-fixing works.\nPrice fixing is an illegal agreement between various corporations not to compete on price below a certain level, to create a big profit margin. Small companies (not part of the illegal agreement) can happily go below that price(option 1), cutting a small gap out of their profit margin.\nRaising prices to non-competitive levels (option 2) has nothing to do with price fixing. That is just default capitalistic behaviour. \n"", '\nLooking for the average wage for a certain type of job is not that hard.\n\nA minimum wage job by definition will attract low skill labor. To make things worse for low skill workers, higher skill workers may take the minimum wage to make an extra buck increasing the pool of available workforce for that minimum wage job. If the average wage for a specific job is higher than the minimum wage, then its not a low skill job, there must be something special about it for the company to have to raise the wage above the minimum wage.\n\nTherefore, we know that our wages are not going to go up, or they would already have done that.\n\nWages don\'t need to go up or change when an employer can pay the minimum allowed and still fill the position. Its an excuse to say ""you don\'t need more because it has been sanctioned"". True, there is no cap on maximum wage, and a lot of profitable companies still pay the minimum wage because they know all of their competitors are paying the same and none of them need to fight to keep their employees. \n\nJobs with wages above minimum wage already exist, so employees already have motivation to seek something better. The only thing you\'d be adding is desperation, because their job no longer pays for living necessities.\n\nA low skill labor as long as they receive a minimum wage that he can live off of will provide no motivation to move.

FYI, i do not argue on the removal of social safety nets, I totally agree that they should exist, but I think the social safety net called ""minimum wage"" is more damaging than good. \nA minimum wage also prevents new companies from opening because the upfront cost of opening a business until it may (or maynot) become profitable is larger. \n\nThis is not how price-fixing works.\n\nThat is totally the motivation behind price fixing. If two large companies get together and set a fixed price above market, to get a higher margin, then all small companies can lower their price and there would be no effect on the market. If the two large companies get together and set a fixed price below market, they may not get a higher margin, but smaller companies cannot compete because they can\'t lower their price and still be able to pay their dues.\n', '\nA minimum wage job by definition will attract low skill labor. \n\nAnd yet you also say\n\nTo make things worse for low skill workers, higher skill workers may take the minimum wage to make an extra buck increasing the pool of available workforce for that minimum wage job.\n\nSo what\'s true? Does the minimum wage attract low skilled labor? Or are higher skill workers ousting low skilled employees? You can\'t have both. Those are inherently contradictory. \nThe difference between my shitty food service job and my first \'professional\' job wasn\'t pay. It was that I had regular hours, I wasn\'t on my feet all the time, I wasn\'t covered in grime, I wasn\'t cleaning up after other people, I didn\'t have to wear a uniform so big on me it was a safety hazard, and I wasn\'t an emotional punching bag anymore for whatever customer was having a bad day.\nIf you spend even a few moments of your time on indeed, you\'ll see many people looking for skills and experience for practically no pay. Because people are desperate. Not because if people at McDonald\'s were literally homeless level poverty it would make receptionists\n\nWages don\'t need to go up or change when an employer can pay the minimum allowed and still fill the position.\n\nI\'m not trying to be rude, but you\'ve missed their point. What they\'re explaining is as it currently is, with no wage ceiling, employers can fill positions. Your CMV was not screw poor unskilled people, they don\'t deserve a livable wage-it was that you think the minimum wage enforces lower wages because of lack of competition. The issue they were explaining is that people can fill these positions right now, McDonald\'s and Walmart and Disney world, in spite of scandals about employee food drives, employees dying in their cars driving back and forth between multiple jobs, homelessness, people walking 7 hours to work, etc, they still do not struggle to fill positions. If they were allowed to pay 1 dollar an hour, I doubt that they would struggle to fill positions-because people are already desperate, and because millions and millions of better paying positions won\'t open up to those people.\n\nA low skill labor as long as they receive a minimum wage that he can live off of will provide no motivation to move. \n\nAs it is right now, the minimum wage doesn\'t really cover rent in any state. It\'s not a livable wage. It\'s an unlivable wage subsidied by people having multiple jobs, many roommates, or welfare. The ""motivation to move"" is that no one wants to need a knee replacement at 45 because cashiers in the us don\'t sit, no one wants to be always exhausted because every week their hours are different, no one wants to constantly be worried about money, no one wants to carry their groceries for a mile, only be able to get drunk as a means of having fun because going anywhere not only costs the price of the ticket but getting there, being available at a time things are open, and having enough time with the extended commute of a bus or walking to even do it...\nI know I sound incensed. I don\'t mean to be insulting. It\'s just that the idea of poverty being something people don\'t want out of because they have no motivation to get better is just ignorant. And when you really think about it...it\'s crazy to look at the service industry, the largest sector of our workforce, a necessity to our day to day function...and say it should be less than a livable wage so that people want to leave it. We don\'t want people to leave it! We need that portion of our economy. Unless grocery stores and coffee shops and warehouse workers and restaurants and shoe stores are all going to be closed during when teenagers are at school...you need that wage to support it\'s employees.\nLike let\'s flip it\n\nA low skill labor as long as they receive a minimum wage that he can live off of will provide no motivation to move. \n\nWhy would a person work a job if they cannot live off of it? What are you working for if not food and shelter and the cost to get to work? And more importantly, if work is not a livable wage how do you afford to work? If it\'s less than now where people are already breaking their backs to make ends meet, and they can\'t live off their wages at all even with that help...why work? If you can\'t afford to live, if you\'re homeless and hungry with a job...might as well be homeless and hungry without it, yeah?\n\nThat is totally the motivation behind price fixing. If two large companies get together and set a fixed price above market, to get a higher margin, then all small companies can lower their price and there would be no effect on the market.\n\nAgain, I really feel you\'re misunderstanding what they\'re saying. A minimum wage isn\'t price fixing because it\'s a minimum, not a maximum...people are still free to pay more to be competitive. Think of it this way- a union saying our employees will only work for at least 14 dollars an hour isn\'t price fixing. \n', 'If the minimum wage didn\'t exist, there would be people getting paid less than the current legal minimum. We know this because as you pointed out, there are currently people that are willing to illegally work for that price. If you return the power for individuals to negotiate their own prices, some with low training or skill will accept lower wages to get a job.\nThe floor for legal employment is fixed by the federal minimum wage, but this only forces businesses to adjust around it. There are only three types on people in a business: owners, workers, and employees. The business has to be profitable or it will close. If we raise the cost of labor (with minimum wage) the owners are forced to charge the customers more.\nOne of the most difficult parts of running a business is finding and retaining good employees. You say that ""  employers have no motivation to increase the wage"", but then why do most people currently make more than the minimum wage? There must be some reason these businesses are paying them extra.\nI think you are putting too much emphasis on the minimum wage as a reference point. A business owner cares about profitability. They want to push all their costs down and make money. If they cant make money there is no reason for them to risk the time and investment to start the business. An employee wants to make as much money as possible. The two parties negotiate and if they can come to an agreement, then they will work together. An employee can demand more money from an employer based on how much value they bring. If someone only produces $10 an hour, that is all I could pay them. If someone is much more skilled and produces $50 an hour I can pay them much more.\n', '\nIf you return the power for individuals to negotiate their own prices, some with low training or skill will accept lower wages to get a job.\n\nThere is a floor to what people can accept to be paid. Unless my assumption is incorrect, minimum wage is tied directly to very low skill labor. Illegal immigrants are not necessarily low skill, a lot of them are cooks, carpenters, electricians, and are willing to take the lower wage because there is an association that if you are an immigrant, you won\'t be able to get paid more than the minimum wage. \n\nThe business has to be profitable or it will close. If we raise the cost of labor (with minimum wage) the owners are forced to charge the customers more. \n\nWhich is another reason on why minimum wage doesn\'t help. Most companies are not profitable 6 months to 1 year after they open. Forcing a minimum wage doesn\'t allow small companies or start-ups to be able to hire because the have to abide a by a law and this forces them to either raise their prices killing their market or go out of business before the hit the profitability point. If there was no minimum wage, they can start low, and if they wish to retain their employers increase the wages and slowly increase their prices to balance it out.\n\nI think you are putting too much emphasis on the minimum wage as a reference point. \n\nYes, I do put a lot of emphasis. I\'ve worked with for two large companies, and the way they set the prices for their products was ""What is the competition doing, let me set the same price"" it was never a calculation on ""how much is my cost, let me set the price on what is my cost and some profitability"". I don\'t find it hard to think that the HR-hiring departments do the same ""Let me see how much the majority is paying, and that\'s how much I will pay""\n', 'Some cooks make minimum wage just FYI.

Some people are willing to work for less than minimum wage. I think you are incorrect. Minimum wage is tied to politics are trying to win votes and not to any particular econ fundamentals.\nHere again I agree forcing a minimum wage doesn't help new business, but in your example the minimum wage makes it too high. Without the legal minimum a new business could pay less in the beginning. This goes against your thought that it is pushing wages down.\nIt is a reference point because it is the floor. It removes the need for all the analysis. The lowest they can legally pay is the minimum, if there was no legal minimum the business would attempt to get labor at a lower price.\n"", '\nThere is a floor and it varies from person to person\n\nThis is my whole point, the variance of what that floor is wouldn\'t allow all companies to pay the same.

For the perspectives of the shareholders and owners: lower wages is more profit. \nIf you can show me that without forced minimum wage the ""actual minimum wage"" (not mandated by law, but market driven value) would be higher than currently. \nIn fact, it will never be higher.\nConsider the following. There is no minimum wage, but for some reason people do not want to work for less than 5$ per hour. This means that the market driven minimum wage would be higher than 5$., let\'s call it 6$ per hour. \nNow let\'s say we set the legal minimum wage at 5$, people still wouldn\'t work for that amount. So the actual minimum wage wouldn\'t change. \nHowever, if people are desperate, they would work for less. So let\'s say that to survive, people would work for 6$ per hour, below that, they\'d rather sit home of something (or result to crime, whatever.). This means that at minimum the corporations have to pay 6$, or no one shows up. \nNow, we set a minimum wage of 7$. Suddenly everyone on the lower ends earns more.  Setting the minimum wage to below six will have no effect on the available employees. \nFor skilled workers, who are in high demand, minimum wage has no effect.\n', '\nFor skilled workers, who are in high demand, minimum wage has no effect.\n\nI agree im talking specifically for low skill workers. \n\nIf you can show me that without forced minimum wage the ""actual minimum wage"" (not mandated by law, but market driven value) would be higher than currently.\n\nLet me try to organize my ideas, because its difficult to write them out.\nFor any wage transaction there are to sides: Employers and employees. \nWhen a minimum wage is set, employers are able to ""wage collude"" legally. For example, a janitor. Companies in an area without having to do any research can set a minimum wage for a janitor position to $15.00 dollars because that is the lowest price they can pay. The employee has no motivation either to try to search around and will take that wage because all other companies would be paying the same. The pool of people that can be a janitors is very large. Hence, there is no motivation for either the company to raise the wage because they know they can quickly replace the person or, the employee to leave the company because if he leaves he won\'t be able to find something that pays better and also if he leaves, all other janitor positions may already be filled. Same goes with a burger flipper, or a stacker at a store (actually i consider a janitor a higher skill job than a burger flipper but I already started my example with him and thats another debate.).\nWhen a minimum wage is not set, Companies have to attempt to find out what is the minimum they can pay to keep that janitor (Not everyone fights for the wage to the bottom, people fight for the lowest wage they are comfortable with to do the job). The janitor knows there variance in wages in janitor positions in all different companies because nobody knows what is the minimum (unless companies collude of course but that could be made illegal to wage fix). Even though the pool of janitor workers may be larger, a company that loses a janitor and needs to back fill it, would have to learn its lesson and increase their wage so they don\'t lose the new janitor they hire. Also, without a minimum wage, companies that couldn\'t be profitable during a minimum wage regulation, may be profitable and be given a chance to exist, increasing the number of janitor positions available. Because more janitor positions  may be available, the variance of janitor wages and the upward wage pressure increases because the number of janitor workers doesn\'t change, but the number of janitor positions increased.\nI hope this makes sense.\n', 'The part you\'re missing is that regardless of this legwork they have to do, they\'d end up with a lower wage. \nTo try and explain as plainly as I can, if John Q Worker is the entire workforce, and John says ""I won\'t do this job for less than $20/hr,"" what difference does it make if the government tells his boss that the lowest they could pay him is $15?  If they want to hire him they have to pay $20 or he doesn\'t take the job.

So now they are needing two jobs and once again there is an oversupply of labour causing wages to stay low. \nDo you keep hearing about companies which employ a lot of people making record profits? For most businesses, more labour equals more production which means more profit. If at the same time you are paying less for that labour that’s even more profit. Quite often the very same companies complain about minimum wage. \nIf these companies are profitable, but they feel that minimum wage is an onerous burden, could it be that wages are low not because there is a government minimum, but because companies are not interested in returning a fair amount of their profits to the labourers that produced it.\nMinimum wage is there because there’s far too many employers that would happily pay almost nothing to get people to perform labour for them. \nMotivation to move around and the idea that there’s something better around the corner. \nSo there is this common incorrect assumption that an employment contract is a mutually beneficial agreement between two equal parties.  An employer names a price and the worker is free to take it or leave it.\nThe problem is there is huge inequality in bargaining power between an employer and most employees, especially unskilled ones. One of the main reasons for this is something called exit cost. Basically, its significantly more expensive for a worker to walk away from the deal if they feel it is unfair than it is for the employer. Workers must sell their labour in order to live as they rarely have the funds to go without work for long, while an employer usually has greater financial reserves and can go longer without hiring someone. \nEven Adam Smith recognised this inequality. \n“In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.”\nAnother reason (once again especially for unskilled labour) is that there is huge competition for limited positions, thus the employer has less need to create incentives to get employees in terms of wages.  Many workers don’t have the capacity to hold out for a better deal, or any leverage to get a better deal. Sure they could leave but it is unlikely that the next employer will pay any more than the last.  This all gets much worse the more wages drop, as the less financially secure an employee is the more he is forced to accept any terms offered to him no matter how unfair. \nPersonally I think that a far better solution would be to eliminate minimum wage and bring in a Universal Basic Income. This would provide a valuable counterweight to give employees greater freedom to negotiate a fair wage or leave a shit job and find another as they wouldn’t have to risk starving or homelessness in the attempt. \nMonopsony\nThis is another major reason for shitty wages, especially when there is high unemployment and low skill workers. \n“Monopsony power exists when one buyer faces little competition from other buyers for that labour or good, so they are able to set wages and prices for the labour or goods they are buying at a level lower than would be the case in a competitive market. A classic theoretical example is a mining town, where the company that owns the mine is able to set wages low since they face no competition from other employers in hiring workers, because they are the only employer in the town, and geographic isolation or obstacles prevent workers from seeking employment in other locations. Other more current examples may include school districts where teachers have little mobility across districts. In such cases the district faces little competition from other schools in hiring teachers, giving the district increased power when negotiating employment terms.” From wiki\n\u200b\nYou are right, minimum wage artificially messes with market forces through government intervention. Its not like businesses don’t constantly try and get government assistance to mess with the market. Just look at copyright and patent law. Those are government granted monopolies. Sure there is a decent rationale for them as a way for the government to reward innovation because its good for society, however we’ve reached a point where the monopoly granted far outreaches the benefits to society for providing such a right.  There are far more cases of the government intervening in the market to help businesses than there are to help workers. \nFinally, the market is amoral. Just because the market says the price for something is x, doesn’t mean that that is a just or fair price. Quite often we must intervene in the interests of the whole of society, not just the self interested. \n', '∆ thank you. Your reasoning is well explained and backed. My CMV was intended in the interest of minimum wage not being the best way to handle the labor wages inequality of today. I should have worded it differently.

Employers could go above $15 to keep/attract talent but they are trying to spend the absolute lowest they can for the job. If there was no minimum the employer would continue to drop wages below $15 until people would no longer work there. \n\n3) low skill employees would have more motivation to move around because something better could be around the corner\n\nBusinesses can already pay more with the minimum wage to attract those workers. The minimum wage is a price floor and not a price ceiling so there already is incentive to entice workers to move. \n', 'People will work because they have to.

Is that an acceptable outcome?  \nI can point to my local job market for a specific example.  We have a small number of fast food joints in town, and a relatively small population/work force.  The people working at the existing places make minimum wage or barely above it if they've been there a long time and have gotten a few raises.  A new fast food place opens up, and they're plastering signs everywhere that their starting pay is 2 or 3 dollars above minimum wage (I can't remember).  Everyone currently working in fast food wants to move there and work for them to get more money, and the new shop gets to pick the best employees so that when they open the doors they've already got an experienced crew that knows what they're doing.\nWithout a minimum wage it will be a race to the bottom -- if there's an abundance of low-skilled laborers, the company can get rid of their higher paid workers and offer lower and lower wages to the new ones to replace them, since people will almost have to take it if they want to get any pay at all.  \n"", 'Correct, they would be paying much less, literally as little as possible -- $1, $2 an hour tops -- and keeping the difference as profit.  \nWhy do you find that outcome more desirable than what we have currently? \n', 'Why do you think that this reference point is so important?\n', 'Though your points are mostly arguable for either side, the thing that you are not presenting are better solutions.

So even though they didn\'t ""buy"" you, you essentially are still a slave, which would make having no minimum wage at all require slavery laws to also be abolished.\nFinally, it would require much more workers rights laws, bureaus, etc. to compensate for not having minimum wage, especially in the US where most states are at-will employment. Even then, as they do with taxes now, businesses would find and lobby for ways around it, whereas something as simple as forcing them to pay employees a minimum amount is something so simple their ""easiest"" solution currently is to illegally hire illegal workers.\n', ""I do agree that better safety nets should exist in place. If there wasn't a minimum wage and there were better safety nets, I bet people would be more willing to move to a job they liked even if it was for a less amount, or be willing to drop their job to get better skills and a higher wage knowing they can still be fed and sheltered while they acquire those skills.\nA better solution would be a wage ratio requirement, where the higherst wages in a company (including shareholders) has to be tied to the lowest earners.\n"", ""Like I said though, those nets are hard to create without holes. To address your solution, what is stopping me from paying everyone nothing and making it all bonuses? Everyone is earning the same wage then.\nAlso, the second option of yours in the first paragraph exists, it is an internship, and companies already find ways to not pay those people at all, without a change in law, so I doubt they would suddenly start paying them.\nTo finish working in reverse, you are talking about the minimum wage here, people making far below the poverty line. Unless they are really young, in which I could see an argument to have no minimum wage for kids under 18, these people likely are already working multiple jobs or are very barely affording to live, so I really don't see them choosing to make even less for a job they like. I make over double minimum wage and as a young man living on my own, I am barely saving money each month with no unexpected charges, just food, rent, etc., and I assuredly would not take a worse paying job that I enjoy more. This makes me highly doubt people who make half of what I do, and may have other people relying on their wage, would want to make a penny less than they do.\nWhich once again my point being, it is easy to see flaws with minimum wage, but coming up with an easy to enforce and comprehensive law to replace it hasn't happened, and until it does it is the best servant of its role.\n"", 'This one has been retread a lot of times but in a competitive labour market:\nIf the MPL is higher than the minimum wage then a minimum wage will make little to no difference.\nIf the minimum wage is set higher than the MPL then after that point, companies will simply not hire any more workers. \nAlthough on the face of it, a minimum wage seems like a policy which should help the poor, it actually has the potential to marginalise and price out the most vulnerable people. People with limited education, skills or experience may not be able to provide enough value to a business to cover the minimum wage leading them not to be hired at all when they might happily accept a lower wage whilst they increase their value. In the long run, overpriced labour will also push companies to invest in other factors of production more quickly than before as their opportunity cost falls compared to the inflated wages.\n', ""The minimum wage incentivizes outsourcing and automation. Cashiers and manufacturing jobs will be replaced by kiosks and outsourced third world labor. The reason these jobs pay so low is because of the threat to outsourcing and technology.

Morever it causes inflation (if you can afford more goods, supply/demand will raise good prices). Without a cap on wages, minimum wage is useless.

25,huadpe,"So I saw this bonkers story being linked, and one thing that stood out to me was this paragraph:[Police Lt.] Doroshov said police opened a case and have been trying to determine which penal code would apply to baking human remains into food. Officers considered a California penal code section regarding the disposal of human remains in an improper manner but public-nuisance charges might be more appropriate, he said.I do not think it is appropriate to try to hunt for a crime like this.  The conduct is very weird and gross, but unless something is clearly a crime, the police should not go around trying to find some tortured interpretation of a criminal statute to make it a crime.  So CMV and show me a part of the California penal code that her conduct violates.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

The crux would be whether ""in a crematory"" refers just to where cremation took place, or if the code limits its scope to things that take place in a crematory, and does not seek to regulate what families do with their loved ones\' ashes once they are brought home.

26,One-vs-1,"TL;DR: Healthcare in the US is a textbook example of price fixing enabled by Insurrance companies and in order to fix it we must break up their ability to collude.First I know next to nothing about the industry but I’ve seen the type of business that healthcare companies run and it’s just an exploitation of the system we’ve created.Within the healthcare industry in the states the hospital has the ability to bill Insurrance companies practically any amount for anything, hence why you see ridiculous charges for frivolous line items, such as billion dollar a year hospitals charging for individual tissues, or the ability to hold your baby after you give birth. This sort of thing in any other industry is tantamount to highway robbery but the medical industry gets a pass because the vast majority of people never see these items, the insurer picks up the bill and it’s forgotten about. So it’s in the hospitals best interest to have these companies as fit and healthy as possible because they can only continue their racketeering unabashed if they have Insurrance companies to match. But if I were to take it a step farther, if you were to look just past initial impressions so to say, this setup is also good for the Insurrance companies. The vast majority of people will pay significantly more into their policy than services they receive. This is obvious because large health insurance companies spatter the Fortune 500 and it’s not unheard of to have executives on 8 figure payrolls. So if you want wider margins, you don’t want cheaper prices, you want more policies. It doesn’t really matter if you have to drop 50k on little Timmy’s MRI for a herniated disk because you have 30 other people that year that never meet their deductible and each of them pays you 15k a year for your “protection”. So how would one go about getting more policies? Well the healthcare in the US is famously expensive. And for most people you can’t exactly go without it now can you? So the Insurrance companies would love for it to cost 2500 every time you visit the ER, because it’s the most effective advertising there is. “Buy what we sell, go broke, or die, pick your poison.” It works to both the hospital and Insurrance’s benefit, hospitals get to frolic in money, insurance companies can all but threaten financial ruin and death upon anyone that doesn’t buy their stuff.  So, make it illegal to sell insurance for healthcare, hospitals will never be able to charge dumb prices, for risk of going broke, and people can utilize an industry the way it’s meant to be, with choices and competition.

Hospitals cannot charge me for holding my own kid after birth and costs aren't ridiculously high.  \nThis happens because the government sits down with the major doctors unions and the major insurance players.  They negotiate prices of things until they've reached something that's acceptable for patients and that the unions and the insurance companies can live with.  \nThere is also a set of laws that, for common services, set a standard price.

There's a sticker price and then there's the price that the insurance company has negotiated. The sticker price you see is generally the price they charge someone without insurance.\n\nThe vast majority of people will pay significantly more into their policy than services they receive.\n\nThat's actually true with just about all insurance. Since insurance is supposed to be for catastrophic events, not mundane things. It's a way to make sure 1 accident doesn't destroy your entire life.\n\nit’s not unheard of to have executives on 8 figure payrolls. \n\nThat's most companies in most industries, not sure why this one is different.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter if you have to drop 50k on little Timmy’s MRI for a herniated disk because you have 30 other people that year that never meet their deductible and each of them pays you 15k a year for your “protection”. \n\nAlso inaccurate. If you are talking about the individual market, it behooves insurance companies to accurately price people. Long example following:\n\nIf you have 4 people and their expected costs of insurance are, $10, $20, $30, & $40, you could charge everyone $25 and be fine, however another company will pop up with a better pricing model and charge 1 group $15 and 1 group $35. The first 2 people will leave your company and pay $15 for their insurance, the second 2 will stay at your company and pay $25. The first company is now getting $50 to cover $70 of expenses, the second is getting $30 to cover $30 in expenses. This means it makes sense for companies to try to keep their prices as low as possible just like any other market. This happens in a similar fashion for large company policies as well.\ninsurance companies can all but threaten financial ruin and death upon anyone that doesn’t buy their stuff. \n\nIf this were accurate we would see this in the auto repair/insurance business as well just to a lesser extent, but we don't.\nThe issue is really that we use health insurance to do basic routine maintenance that no other insurance industry does. Home insurance doesn't cover you maintaining your house, auto insurance doesn't cover for you to change your oil, they only cover accidents. \n"", 'I’m on mobile so RIP formatting. I’ll just use #’s based on the order of your reply. \n#1 if you negotiate a cough drop from $10 to $2.50 you’ve saved 75%.

The ability to price someone out of a lifetime worth of money for a treatment that outside of the lens of healthcare is hyper-inflated to nauseating numbers is the result of the relationship between healthcare and insurance companies.

You fit into the risk index here (x) so you can either purchase more comprehensive insurance for a higher premium or for a reduced premium we can make your deductible astronomical. Not a problem in and of itself but these companies share similar risk indexes creating a de-facto fixed market with each company charging similar rates only adjusting coverage and deductibles but in the end arriving at similar pricing. \n#5 The auto industry has liability Insurrance to satisfy the law but provides no protection to yourself. You can get along without a car, so incentive is different. Lastly repair shops are forced to be competitive because sans essential function of the car it still serves its purpose.

When I need emergency care I don\'t have time to call every hospital near me to determine who had the most reasonable prices and best services. And once I show up at the hospital i may not know enough about medicine to understand what they plan to do to me and the associated costs with it. Is that MRI really necessary or could they diagnose it with just a regular x-ray? Is there ""better"" medication really worth the extra money or will I have I there same outcome with the cheaper medicine? \nEven as a doctor I might not know all these answers because my problem might be outside my speciality or maybe it\'s a statistical thing: option A has good outcomes 80% of the time but cost twice as much as option B that has good outcomes 60% of the time.\nI agree the system is broken, but choices and competition aren\'t the real fix. They need to exist, for example my ex had to have emergency surgery and choose to go to one hospital over another because as a nurse, she didn\'t trust the doctor that would do the surgery at the bigger hospital. But for the average consumer, they wouldn\'t know the difference. \n', 'The point is that you should be able to have a competitive choice. Emergency care constitutes a (hopefully) small fraction of your medical costs. All the follow up treatment and care associated once your condition is stable and you’re lucid enough to make decisions should be your choice and the hospitals that administer the best medicine at the most reasonable price in your area should get the most business. You are ultimately the final say as to whether you get an X-ray or an mri, medicine A or B. You should have the choice.\n', ""But it isn't the small part of the cost. For a non-life threatening issue an emergency visit is typically 10 to 15 times the cost of a visit to a doctor's office. For life threatening conditions it can easily be 100 times the cost of the follow up visits. But the other issue is do you know what the best medical decisions are? Most likely not unless you are in the medical field yourself. In the case of my ex, would you have known that the surgeon on call that night at the large hospital in town had worse outcomes than the surgeon on call at the smaller hospital? Would you have even known that you needed emergency surgery and needed to make that decision? There was one follow-up visit, that cost about $120, the surgery cost about $8000. Even if we had wanted to save money by going to a cheaper doctor for the follow up, he would have referred us back to the surgeon that did the procedure.\nAs to whether to have an MRI or an x-ray, would you be able to tell which conditions can be reliably diagnosed with one vs the other? Most can't. They have to rely on the doctors to explain to them the value of one choice vs the other. Can you reasonably weigh the value of one choices potential outcomes vs the others when making a decision about what to do? And also those decisions are typically needing to be made during the emergency phase of a visit. X-ray and MRI are diagnostic tools, so those are going to be done before you are treated. The choice of medicine a or b, you may need to know that while medicine b is cheaper, and it's less likely to work, it is also less likely to make things worse if it falls.\nMy statement was't that the system shouldn't be changed, it's that the system can't support true competition because the customer is always at a knowledge disadvantage.\n"", ""I'm confused, are you advocating for just absolutely no healthcare insurance or a government nhs style?\n"", '\nthe insurer picks up the bill and it’s forgotten about.\n\nThe insurer does NOT just pay whatever.\n\nIn-network hospitals:  These are hospitals that the insurer has made special negotiations with and decided on all prices in advance.  The hospital will often still send a bill for an absurd amount because the contract usually specifies ""The amount previously negotiated or the billed amount, whichever is lower"", but that amount will just not be paid.  Hospital could bill $3,000, the insurer could pay $900 and the patient could pay $100, because the negotiated rate was $1000. Insurers try to steer you towards these because they are cheaper for everyone and also can be thought of as a reward to the hospital for providing a discount.\nOut-of-network hospitals: These are hospitals don\'t have an agreement with your insurer.  In your contract, the insurer might pay 70% instead of 90%, but also have various types of caps.  So if the hospital bills $3000, but that is way above normal for that region for that procedure, the insurer may cap the bill to, say, $2500 and then they\'d 70% of that, meaning the patient might owe $500 for the portion that the insurer wasn\'t covered and also 30% of what is covered (30% of 2500 is $750) because that is what might be in your contract  for using out of network hospitals.  So the patient ends up paying $500+$750, though that would still register against their out of pocket maximum.  Some insurance plans have different out of pocket maximum for out of network providers.\n\n', 'This was brought up earlier but it it’s all gonna come back to this for me, it’s not a 50% discount if it’s price has been marked up 100%. These “negotiated prices” couldn’t ever be viable market prices because the point they start their negotiation from is an arbitrary often exuberant number. If you took the insurers out of the picture prices would be lower than even that negotiated number imo.\n', 'That is not at all accurate.  First, insurers do what they can to keep their product cheap and negotiating good rates is the MOST important part of that and they aren\'t stupid enough to fall for the ""We marked this up so it\'d look like we were giving you a discount"".\nNext, hospitals aren\'t just making bank.  A bunch of hospitals closed last year.  Their operating margin is less than 5%.\n\nIf you took the insurers out of the picture prices would be lower than even that negotiated number imo.\n\nWhen you go to an out of network hospital, where you\'re actually going to end up being responsible for a big chunk of the bill, do you shop around to different hospitals? Do you find out the price? Or do you just throw up your arms and say ""fine"" when the hospital can\'t tell you in advance how much it\'ll cost because it is really really complicated and depends on a lot of factors.  I\'ve been to places that don\'t even accept insurance and finding out prices is very difficult, EVEN if you know exactly what you\'re going to get and who is going to provide it.\nThey use codes to represent what they\'re going to do, and for procedures there is about 8000 of which, many of which you\'d practically need to be an actual MD to tell apart, and that is before you get into all the other coding standards that even a single facility would use, which includes 14,000 diagnosis codes, and that is before you even get into all the specialized coding that hospitals use.\n', 'I agree with your assessment of the problem (crazy prices) but I disagree with the cure you propose. \nIn many countries health insurance doesn’t exist.
