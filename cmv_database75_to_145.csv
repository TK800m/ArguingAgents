0,Klinging-on,"I imagine the Aliens as either a slightly more technologically advanced species or a ""hive"" species. In the former technological gap between humanity and these aliens would be about the difference between WW2 era to now. The second alien species would be a hive-mind type which would have the advantage of adaptability and very fast population growth with the necessary resources. The second is comparable to the Zerg from Starcraft, Flood from Halo, Xenomorph from the Alien franchise, Bugs from Starship troopers, etc. I think humanity would eventually win if either of the Aliens invaded and that there would be benefits to the invasion. Humanity would put aside their differences and combine their forces to resist the alien invasion. This would be unprecedented in human history and allow for a closer, less xenophobic world. The Aliens would wipe out a good percentage of humanity before they were beaten back. This would end some of the major issues of our time such as climate change and overpopulation, which threaten to create instability and kill good amounts of humanity themselves.Economic inequality would decrease, leading to a more stable society. WW2 destroyed huge amounts of physical capital through bombs and guns, financial wealth through inflation, and human capital through all the human lives it took. However after all this economic inequality in the US and Europe was at its lowest ever. As a result we had a stable society (this happened in WW1 as well, read Picketty's Capital in the 21st century for more on this).If the Aliens are the technologically advanced species, the race to reverse their technologically could further humanity. To beat the technologically advanced species I states above, we would need to force them to deploy ground forces to delay while we reverse engineer their technology as fast as possible. I'm not sure how we would do the former, the latter would be huge benefit to humanity. We would suddenly have the technology for inter-space travel, deadly precise weapons, self-sustainment, and all the side technologies and derivatives of these.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1,chadonsunday,"​Fairly self explanatory. I don't particularly care which way it goes on this, but I feel when it comes to insurance rates and protected groups I think it should be all or nothing.My understanding is that auto insurance companies use various markers when determining the rates for those they insure. Currently age and sex are two such markers: a 16-25yo male, for example, would be more expensive to insure compared with a 30-40yo female. They arrive at this conclusion by running the numbers and finding that young males get in more costly accidents more often than older females (or even younger females) and therefore end up costing the insurance company more, so charge them more.I find this rather baffling since age and sex are classes that are federally (E: federally in the broadest sense, but more specific protections exist by state, like ones specifically regarding public accommodations or business establishments; many states have also massively increased the number of protected groups. All this to say that ""federal"" isn't crucial to my view here) protected from discrimination. Charging someone more for the same service (insuring their vehicle) because of their age or sex seems like quite blatant discrimination. Ideally, I think these markers should be removed (and insurers can fall back to the many other non-protected markers they currently use, such as driving records, miles per year, area of residence, etc.) OR all protected classes should be fair game. If insurance companies can crunch the numbers and determine that men are more costly to insure than women, and young people are more costly to insure than older people, surely they could do the same when it comes to race/ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, etc. It may turn out, for example, that whites get into more accidents than blacks, and insurance companies could charge them more just like they currently do based on age/sex metrics. Again, I don't particularly care which way this would go, but logical consistency seems to be a bit lacking in the current system.I think this issue is a bit more significant than other frequently discussed examples of discrimination (e.g. the wedding cake for the gay couple) since driving an automobile, while not a right, is much more significant and essential to many people's lives than their ability or non-ability to use any baker they want to get a cake. Also, while insurance companies are private entities, the government requires that you be insured if you want to drive. I think this issue is more akin to similar conversations regarding the ACA and how and why it's unfair (and perhaps discriminatory) for women to have to pay more for health insurance (even though they're more costly to insure).One counterargument that I won't find particularly compelling: differences between the sexes (e.g. testosterone causing more aggressive driving) or ages (e.g. brain development makes you drive better). These arguments are very likely true, but when it comes to discrimination of whole groups the ""why"" is irrelevant to me. In part because I could see how some similar ""why""s, if studied, could easily be extended to other protected groups: perhaps one ethnic group tends to have a slower reaction time than others; perhaps pregnant women drive more erratically due to hormones; perhaps parents on average get less sleep and sleep deprived people don't drive as well, etc. But more importantly, even if all of these things are true the whole point of not discriminating is that you can't assign certain characteristics or abilities to whole groups of people (many of them numbering in the hundreds of millions or even billions) and then treat every member of that group on that basis even if you have data suggesting those traits are on average more common among members of said group. This is unfair because averages aside you have no way of knowing, just based on the data alone, if individual members of those groups actually have those traits (e.g. it's perfectly possible that a male can be cautious and responsible get through his 16-25 range without so much as a parking ticket while a woman in her 30-40s can reckless and be getting into accidents every other month).TL;DR: What auto insurance companies are doing is essentially a form of profiling, using a couple protected classes as a basis for discrimination. If that's the way they want to go, I don't see why they're just limiting themselves to two when they could profile even more accurately by using all of them. Or, we can acknowledge that they shouldn't be discriminating against protected groups at all and age and sex should stop being markers for insurance rates.Edit: I feel I was a little too careless in my use of legally-charged terminology, and some folks corrected me on that. I've awarded some partial deltas for that further down. Going forward the only view left to change is my main one: it's fucked up for auto insurance companies, as the providers of a near-essential and legally required product, to be discriminating based on sex and age alone. They either shouldn't be doing that, or all other metrics (religion, race, etc.) should be open for auto-insurance discrimination, too.Y'all know what to do.

I did make it rather clear in the OP, though (and in many other comments here) that I\'m well aware of that. I\'ve used such things to my advantage in the past. \nMore to the point, your latter paragraph is exactly what I\'m trying to get at, here: if insurers were found out to be using race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. (even if they were backed by cold, hard stats) to determine insurance rates, there would be a fucking outrage. Which is why I\'m baffled that they\'re allowed to get away with the exact same practice when applied to sex and age. Some things aren\'t justifiable when it comes to garnering outrage; if your driving record is a mess because you total a car every few years it makes perfect sense that the insurance company would charge you more. Just the fact that you possess a penis, though? Really? That\'s a justification for charging more? I get that it\'s statistically backed, but other metrics (race, religion, etc.) could be statistically backed if they were studied (and in some cases they have been, like that perhaps blacks speed more (and more egregiously) than other racial demographics), too. \nBut yeah, people would throw a fit if the group harmed by what another commetor (who is an auto insurance agent) termed ""determining risk factors"" was a POC group, or female, or gay, etc. The fact that they\'re just discriminating against young dudes seems to somehow make it okay. I think there should be outrage that they\'re doing that OR we as a society should acknowledge that this kind of data can be studied for all groups (just as soundly as it is for age and sex), and insurance rates might raise or fall on that basis. Personally I\'m cool with either one, but it seem to be we need to pick a side. Logical consistency demands it. If insurance can be sexist, it can be racist, too. If insurance can\'t be racist, it can\'t be sexist, either. Insurance companies shouldn\'t be able to say ""well X and Y groups are totally fine to study and discriminate against... but groups A, B, C, and D are totally out of the question."" They should either study (and insure differently based on that) groups A - Z or they shouldn\'t study (and insure differently) any of those groups at all.

I'm in agreement with everything that you wrote.

I think the biggest flaw here is how important race and religion is to risk for the insurance company. \n\nthey could easily run the numbers for religious groups or races etc\n\nThat's absolutely right. Similarly, they could also run the numbers for favorite TV shows, favorite podcasts, and favorite music. From that they could find that those who listen to classical music have fewer accidents than those who listen to rock or rap. But this would be largely redundant as far as a rating factor goes. Insurance companies already take into consideration the zip code, the credit score, the occupation, and education of clients.\nWhile those who listen to classical are safer than those who listen to rap and rock, the difference between someone who has a different music preference in the same zip code, credit rating, occupation, and education would be very minimal. Do you see what I mean? A Beverly Hills lawyer, who listens to rap, would have a nearly identical rating as a Beverly Hills lawyer who listens to classical, verse a Compton dollar store employee who listens to rap vs classical.\nConversely, age and sex can NOT be expressed through zip code, credit, occupation, or education. A college educated 40 year old woman in Beverly Hills driving a 2018 BMW is a lot lower risk than a 16 year old Beverly Hills boy driving a Beamer. And a 16 year old Beverly Hills girl is a lower risk than the boy.\nSo, while I agree with you they could take race and religion into account, they could take a lot of things into account also, but it wouldn't make a significant difference with all the other risk factors that already use- while age and gender actually do make a huge difference on risk factors.\n"", 'So I hate to be ""that guy"" but do you have any sources for this (i.e. the whole rap vs rock listeners thing)? I mean, it makes a lot of sense that the difference wouldn\'t be that great (and perhaps not significant enough for insurance companies to bother tracking) but I\'m going off nothing but my gut and own anecdotal experience (I noticed my driving calmed down quite a bit when I transitioned to NPR and podcasts on my drives as opposed to metal and techno), here. \nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s actually true or, even if the margins are fairly small, that it wouldn\'t be worth the company\'s time to track and measure. Even if it\'s just, say, a $3 a month difference, the largest auto insurance company, State Farm, insures 44,000,000 vehicles. Multiply that by twelve months a year and the $3 difference and you\'re looking at a ~$1,500,000,000 metric the company isn\'t capitalizing on. Just a little thought experiment. \nSo yeah. Maybe sex and age are the biggest factors (aside from the big, non-""protected"" ones like your actual driving record). But just because other factors aren\'t as big do we have any proof they\'re not worth the company\'s time? In short, are they not gauging insurance rates based on race because race is virtually irrelevant, or because they can\'t legally? \n', '\nSo I hate to be ""that guy"" but do you have any sources for this (i.e. the whole rap vs rock listeners thing)?\n\nNo, there\'s no actuary data for this.\n\nBut just because other factors aren\'t as big do we have any proof they\'re not worth the company\'s time? \n\nNo, there\'s no direct proof that it\'s a large or small issue. I\'m just using deductive reasoning since differences is race largely disappear when controlled for by intelligence and income, which is highly correlated with credit, zip code, occupation, and education.\nDo you think there\'s a significant racial difference in the way people drive that can\'t be controlled for by intelligence and income? And why do you think it\'s an equally relevant factor for age and gender?\n', 'You have to remember what insurance is.

In much the same way the ACA made a moral argument for why women shouldn't have to pay more for health insurance even though there was credible statistics showing it just made good sense for why they should have to. I think insurance companies are getting somewhat of a free pass on the two categories I've focused on because they're discriminating primarily against young dudes. If they were discriminating against POC, homosexuals, or Christians something tells me they would've been forced to abandon those metrics a long time ago after much outrage. And my point is that I don't really see a difference in these metrics. If you can use sex to determine insurance rates there's no reason you can't use race, religion, orientation, etc. And if you don't think insurance companies should be using those latter metrics, it's equally unfair for them to be using sex and age.

Age and sex aren’t the only things taken into account, there are a lot of things that go into determining risk.

So until the department of insurance will allow us to use other factors, we are stuck with the age/sex/marital status as part of the formula for how risky a driver might be or not. \nEdit: In typing all that out I missed a big point. We aren’t discriminating against people, we are determining risk factors in how much we need to charge this person to break even in case they get in an accident. When an accident costs you $30k to cover somebody, but you only charge them $2k a year in insurance, you are taking a bet that while with you, they won’t get in an accident and cost you more. \n', 'Hey, glad to have caught the attention of a industry professional! I was hoping that might happen. Thanks for the insight. \nIn regards to your first five paragraphs (based on what you said in the sixth) I think you realized that I\'m not unaware that sex and age aren\'t the only metrics that auto insurers use. I\'m aware of many of these factors, and have used them to my benefit in the past (like when I was able to walk to work every day my insurance was lower than it is now with my 2.5hr round trip daily commute, despite me being several years older now than I was then... and it makes sense; on the road more = more of a risk). \nSo to hone in on your last paragraph (let me know if I\'m skipping over anything in the former ones that you\'d like addressed), I\'d argue that you are both discriminating and ""determining risk factors."" They don\'t have to be mutually exclusive. For example, if a bar found that white folks were statistically more likely to steal from the bar, start fights, waste employee time, etc. and decided to charge whites more for drinks for those reasons, that would be both discriminatory and ""determining risk factors."" I don\'t think it needs to be explained, especially to you, why it\'s determining risk factors, but it\'s also discriminatory because the stats you have don\'t say a damn thing about any individual white person who enters your bar - it says something about white people on average. Treating all whites in a special and certain way because of statistical realities that individual whites might not conform to is discriminatory. Some better examples might be things like an employer not hiring women because they\'re statistically likely to get pregnant and want maternity leave. From a company bottom-line standpoint that\'s just ""determining risk factors""... but it\'s also discrimination. Or perhaps you, as a landlord, have data that shows green people are more likely to trash your property, throw loud parties, and upset other renters; not renting to green people would just be you calling a shot after ""determining risk factors""... but it would also be discrimination. \nMore to the point, your data that shows males are more costly to insure says something about men, but not about me, per se, or my buddy Jeff, or my girlfriend. It\'s totally possible that both my gf and Jeff are horrible, reckless drivers, but I\'m not. Out of the three of us your discriminatory assumptions are only true for Jeff... because while your stats say something about ""men"" and ""women"" they don\'t say anything about me or Jeff or my girlfriend. We\'re all individuals. Treating individuals of a group in a certain way because of the assumption or factually based data that indicates some/most of them are more prone to X is essentially the definition of discrimination. \n\u200b\n', 'I think we need to adjust your definition of discrimination: Unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people. I would argue that determining risk factors based on statistical data is neither unjust nor prejudicial. \nSo to give you an idea of how the rating works, everyone starts off at a 1.00 at a base level. \nLapse in coverage? Your risk factor increases by 1.21. \nLow credit score? Increase it by 1.9 \nLess than 5 years driving experience? Increase it by 1.3. More than 5 but less than 10? Increase by 1.2 instead. Over 10? Increase by 1.00.  \nGood student? Increase by .90 (this results in a decrease). Driver training? Increase by .90. Defensive driver? Increase by .90. \nSingle male between 27 - 29? Increase by 1.408, married male between 27 - 29? Increase by 1.100\nTake all the risk factors multiplied together to get the final risk factor. Now for each coverage take the base premium and multiply by the risk factor. This is of course an over simplified example of how rating works, but I wanted to point out that gender and age only play a small role in these factors. The primary time it is weighed more than other factors is the 0 - 24 age range and the 75+ age ranges, but these are offset by individual risk factors decreasing from good student, driver training and defensive driver (no at fault accidents).  \nA lot of what we can use is limited or required by the Department of Insurance, and the crunched numbers and statistics show that age/gender/marital status is the most reliable model we can use. It might feel unjust that your factor is higher because you are a single male under age 24, but if the statistics clearly show that 8 out of 10 drivers in that category are a higher risk of having an accident and you have 20k drivers in that category on your book of business, you know you have a high chance of having to cover 18k accidents. So you have to charge more to cover that cost and it isn’t unjust for a company to do that. Is it prejudicial against you? Not really, it is a small part of the rating factors, and there are discounts to offset the group factor based on individuals. \nThis is where the bar analogy fails, a bar makes drinks, it costs them x amount to make said drink, and they charge based on that. The bar has insurance to cover the other items. Their cost of insurance is built into the cost of the drink. It would also be counter productive to a bar to come up with such a pricing schema because they want to turn over drinks fast, so if your bartender is having to calculate out complex pricing algorithms based on individual risk factors, drinks won’t be turned over quickly, and the bar will make less money. \nOther institutions that I’ll throw out that use factors in making decisions based on groups that might seem discriminatory are collages for admissions and banks for loans, just to name two. \nIf you could name a better model that is realistic for determining risk factors for thousands of drivers that you barely know anything about that doesn’t dig down into getting extremely personal, I would love to hear it.

I was raised as a Christian in America. I\'m well-read in western philosophers, and I currently describe myself as a secular Buddhist. I will explain what Buddhism has provided for me that western philosophy has not.\nThe short version is: Buddhism offers specific, practical advice about what actions to take to improve your human experience.\nFirst, let me talk about how Buddhism has made me more loving and kind. It doesn\'t take a philosophical genius to figure out that we ought to do good to others. I was taught that as a Christian, I read about that in Plato and Kant, etc. Buddhism explicitly describes actions I can take that will enhance my ability to be loving to others. In short, I make a conscious effort to reorient my thoughts to be more loving to others, even when I would naturally feel otherwise. In addition to doing this in my daily life, I take time occasionally to meditate explicitly about my feelings of love for myself and others. There is no doubt in my mind that this has made me a better person.\nNext, I\'ll talk about how Buddhism has helped me avoid feeling depressed or annoyed while instead finding more joy in the little things. Secular Buddhism as I practice it is based on mindfulness meditation, which allows me to understand the world as it really is. By taking 20-30 minutes a day simply experiencing that, ""This is what existence is like,"" I come to better understand how all pains and pleasures are ephemeral and how ideas like self and other are human constructions rather than fundamental features of reality. I am now better able to perceive the sound of people chewing, previously a tremendous source of annoyance for me, as merely sound empty of any meaning or feeling. Because it is empty of feeling, I do not identify with any annoyance thereof.\nI have read some people argue that secular Buddhism isn\'t actually anything new. Modern neuroscience is enough to tell us that the self is an illusion, modern acoustics is enough to tell us that the sound of people chewing is empty of meaning, and cognitive behavioral therapy teaches us how to consciously reorient our thoughts to become more loving. And that\'s all true. Honestly, if it weren\'t for acoustics, neuroscience, and CBT, I would never have bought into Buddhism in the first place.\nWhat Buddhism has given me, above and beyond what western science and philosophy has, is a plan of action. Having implemented that plan in the last six months, I\'m satisfied with it so far.\n', 'I\'m gonna ignore the inherent subjectivity in a lot of what you said, because you didn\'t really compare ""Asian"" and ""Western"" philosophy in many meaningful ways (I\'m sure plenty of people don\'t find much utility in the writings of Plato, for example).\nRather, I\'m gonna focus on what your view seems to be of ""usefulness"" in philosophy. Just because you don\'t find anything personally useful in those philosophies doesn\'t mean that learning about them is pointless. When you learn about Buddhism, Daoism, etc., you\'re learning about the cultures that they came up in and shaped, and thus gaining a greater cultural knowledge of the world, which is in itself useful.\n', ""I've found the Hindu pramanas to be relatively interesting and useful for organizing evidence in support of logical argument.  They are more comprehensive than Aristotelian logic and (to me) more accessible than more modern Western epistemology.\nFrom Wikipedia: Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six pramanas as correct means of accurate knowledge and to truths: perception (Sanskrit pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), comparison and analogy (upamāna), postulation, derivation from circumstances (arthāpatti), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof (anupalabdhi) and word, testimony of past or present reliable experts (Śabda).

Conversely it also advises rulers that if they want to keep their jobs they need to treat their people well. While this might seem like captain obvious to you, the modern western, you have to understand that throughout human history there have been societies hell bent on conquest, rising and falling within a century with countless dead and cultures lost to antiquity. Chinese culture has endured thousands of years with social upheaval usually sparked by ecological disaster. After all, Laozi teaches nothing about drought, except to perhaps die. Which in all honesty is unreasonable as it is against the most base human instinct. The modern world, especially the west, very much follows Laozi. People are well fed, are permitted to be who they want and are content in ignorance. Isn't this better than murdering each other over imaginary truths or who are the most devout followers of an imaginary omnipotent being?\n"", 'The most useful, practical and impactful lessons I\'ve learned were from Buddhism.\nThe Buddha taught that suffering comes from wanting impossible things. It comes from wanting your parents to never die, or wanting your significant other to love you forever no matter what. It comes from desiring people you have no control over to behave in a specific way that suits you.\nIf you can teach yourself to stop your desire for these things, to stop making your happiness conditional on these things, you can spare yourself so much suffering.\nA parable that described it well was about a man who came to the Buddha complaining about a terrible pain in his hand. He was holding a hot coal. The Buddha told him that the coal was causing the pain, and he needed to let it go. If we could all see so clearly how our actions are causing ourselves pain, we would be able to let go very easily. Because it doesn\'t make sense to hurt ourselves.\nThese lessons resonate with me, and they\'ve helped me change for the better.\nIt\'s possible that lessons like this exist in Western thought. But the concept of ""letting go of desire"" is a distinctly Buddhist teaching that many westerners need to hear.\n', ""Buddhism as a philosophy, is very compatible with western scientific thought, so I don't really see your point...\n"", ""So you don't see any potential risks with just discounting an entire half of the world's philosophy? No potential net loss of material? They're over there just spouting bullshit for some reason?\n"", ""There's a saying in middle-Eastern philosophy/religion that a prophet is not honored in his own turf. (Pretty sure this tradition has moved west and been adopted in Europe fairly widely.)\nI think you have a real point about truth being accessible to all people across the world, and your own local traditions of philosophy containing the same truths, packaged differently. Laozi sounds a lot like Plato, regarding the ideal versus the real (even though the alchemists that claim devotion to each have taken wild tangents in different directions). Bodhidarma knew his way around the inside of his own mind, but then again, so did Loyola.\nThe point of looking to some foreign tradition, in my opinion, is that it can dress ordinary truths up in an air of the exotic, and make us aware of things that would otherwise be too obvious to notice.

3,iucking_fdiot_,"My entire life I've always eaten bagels of all kinds, regardless of the toppings (fillings?) in a closed face manner. In fact I truthfully never even saw anyone eat a bagel open faced (2 individual halves) until my wife did it, and I couldn't understand how anyone could do that. Isn't the whole point of a bagel to be eaten closed face? Eating it open faced would just lead to everything on the bagel sliding around everywhere, making a huge mess, and reducing the enjoyment of said bagel. Furthermore, eating a bagel open faced means you would have to hold it by the edges, getting whatever is in the bagel on your hands, while eating closed face allows you to hold from the top and bottom of the bagel, eliminating this. I could maybe see something plain, like a plain toasted bagel, being eaten open faced, but if you're going to add toppings, it needs to be closed faced. My final thought on this, perhaps the way bagels are eaten varies based on geographic location, and this is entirely a product of where I was raised. I won't say specifically where, but I was raised in the suburbs outside New York City, if that has any bearing on the style of bagel eating.","['DeltaBot', 'huadpe', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'huadpe', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DeltaBot', 'DoomFrog_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DoomFrog_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DoomFrog_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'Salanmander', 'DrKomeil', 'ElBlancoDiablo22', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DeltaBot', 'cacheflow', 'PronunciationIsKey', 'draculabakula', 'cptnhaddock', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'ktsportsgirl']","[""/u/iucking_fdiot_ (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""I am also from the NY suburbs, and eating open face bagel halves is incredibly common here.

As opposed to a Closed Face style I would only have 1 bagel's size worth of bites.\nNext there is the 'Sandwich Pinch' effect.

When I'm with my gay friends I'm far more likely to tell a joke about the gay experience than when I'm with my family. Because they'll get it. \nThe second however comes from a toxic idea that men shouldn't have feelings, especially around other men. This kind of thinking hurts men and I'd say it's a sexist constraint on them. Now maybe we can agree you're not being intentionally sexist but the ideas of society that men are emotionless and stoic is a sexist idea towards men.\n"", 'I guess this stems from my personal experiences. For example, I am more likely to bring my emotional problems to my mom because she has always been easier to talk to about that. I love my dad, but we just relate to each other in other ways.\n', ""You mention that you're looking for ways that it might have a harmful effect on others. Well, the fact that you're less likely to talk about emotions with guys doesn't necessarily indicate overt sexism on your part, but it does have a harmful effect. The idea that men don't want to talk about emotions leads to men being less likely to talk about emotions, and it's a cycle of self-fulfilling stereotypes. Your tendencies are a tiny piece of that puzzle, and have a small effect towards keeping that cycle going.\n"", 'Your analogy/anecdote bears a strong resemblance to what many women refer to as “toxic masculinity”, primarily the latter part of your analogy, in regards to being more emotionally accessible and open with a female versus a male (ie your mother vs your father).  From what I’ve been told by women, a characteristic of this multifaceted issue are men who feel the need to disguise, stifle, or ignore their emotions for fear of being perceived as weak or inadequate somehow by their fellow males.\nThe raunchy male jokes are a social aspect that comes with the territory of being a male, and being a man comes with its own unique experiences, just like being born female has its own respective trials and tribulations.  Neither are inherently bad or good. They’re special in their own distinctive yet positive ways. \nMen are always going to lead vastly different lives than females, in every way, shape and form. Being wary or apprehensive to discuss certain things in the presence or immediate proximity of women isn’t inherently sexist, society just says it is, since we are so used to having distinctly male and females spaces. \nSocially, I think we are on a path towards gender neutrality (personally not my cup of tea, but more power to you if that’s your sort of thing) and once that day and age arrives, you won’t have to deal with or worry about the possibility of appearing sexist or the potential social stigmas that could occur from discussing certain subjects around females. \nHope this helped you answer your question. \n', ""And yeah it makes sense, because society has conditioned them to be more like that. And it's this conditioning that's sexist. I'm not saying it's wrong for you to talk to your mom over your dad, only that in the long run we should seek to eliminate the conditioning that makes it easier for basically every person to talk to their mom about that stuff than their dad. \n"", 'You\'re literally discriminating based on sex, so it\'s sexism. Whether it\'s respectful or derogatorily, it depends on the person. \nIn the first scenario, I\'m anatomically female (though it\'s a gray area whether I identify as a woman), and I am comfortable with penis jokes. In fact, another friend and I make penis jokes, randomly say penis cus lol and leave graffitis of penises in inappropriate places. If I was with you and a bunch of male friends, holding yourself back from making a joke about penis is not necessary and will make me feel like my presence a party pooper. It\'s about as frustrating as the notion that males shouldn\'t curse in front of females. \nIn the second scenario, I don\'t think there\'s anything necessarily wrong with preferring to talk about something personal and sensitive to certain people. If they all  happen to be a certain gender, that\'s fine too. However, I don\'t think it\'s healthy to only share or feel comfortable sharing a specific gender. \nBut isn\'t it better to just consider it on an individual-by-individual basis?

It's a physical thing. The second one isn't sexist per se, but it does suggest some unnecessary discomfort with emotional intimacy with people of the same sex. That isn't a great thing because you are locking out half the world from that level of friendship.  \n"", 'I agree with the last part but I also think it is somewhat natural. For example, moms tend to be the emotional support for children while dads tend to offer other things\n', ""My experience in the world is that men are entirely capable of emotional complexity, intimacy, and support. Moreover, it is my experience that they are much more fulfilled when they don't pretend like they aren't capable of these things as some sort of false bravado. I'm not saying you have to throw all cultural norms out the window, but Bros can absolutely share a common language of emotions and support. And in fact, life is better when they do. \n"", ""We tend to think of these stereotypes as natural. But there's not any scientific evidence that men are naturally less capable of feeling than women are, or of listening and supporting. We haven't discovered any genes that can predict these behaviors reliably, or any brain areas that differ between men and women that might predict a difference in those behaviors between men and women.\n"", 'The pattern of behavior you\'re describing does negatively affect women (and men). Let me be very specific about what I mean here.\n\nIn the same way, I am much more likely to talk about emotions with a close female friend rather than a guy friend because I just feel awkward talking about stuff like that with my guy friends.\n\nThis is an extremely common experience for men, who, frankly, are taught that having vulnerable emotions like sadness, anxiety, or fear in front of other men will lead to them being viewed as weak, ""not a real man,"" or a ""pussy."" Men are taught that it\'s important to be rational and unemotional, that being emotional is not manly. Some men learn in high school that talking about emotions like these can even lead to getting bullied or being physically harmed. So they learn to bottle it up, to not speak about these feelings at all or at least not with other guys. When they do go to someone to open up, it is quite often the women in their life.\nThis leads to a situation where a lot of responsibility falls on to women to help men get their own emotional deck of cards together. This, right there, is an inequality in emotional labor. But quite often men don\'t open up at all--their emotions come out in other ways. Men are at a much higher risk of drug or alcohol use disorders. Men are also much more likely to act violently. Quite often, taking drugs, taking risks, or acting out are ways of expressing distress for men who know no other way of venting their distress. Again, the victims of these behaviors are sometimes men and sometimes women. That is a clear negative effect.\nMore broadly, the way we think about emotions as feminine and rationality as masculine has negative implications for the way we think about career options, who is supposed to raise children and stay at home, who should be good at math and science etc...\nSo while the preference for talking about emotions with women is a relatively small preference in the grand scheme of society, it does reflect and contribute to sexism.\n\u200b\n', ""Sexism - characterized by prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.\nYou are stereotyping on the basis of sex.

If you're saying it's okay to not talk about women about penises, you're close to justifying not going to a female urologist based on sex, thus basically preventing females from becoming urologists - a rather well paid profession. While not overwhelming, it's certainly somewhat oppressive to force women out of a certain profession.\nEDIT: Yes women also need urologists - urologists generally spend more time with male patients b/c urologists also function as sexual/reproductive health physicians for males (similar to ob/gyns for females).

They say that anyone who says that it matters who is saying something and where and to whom matters is being sexist or racist. That\'s nonsense.

Do you think actors have something at stake by not showing their movie?\nThe issue is that distributors and other, larger entitles, who have a hold over distribution in other areas don't let these things happen because they don't get paid.  If I made a movie with Big Studios Inc. in America and wanted to stream or show my movie in Germany, it might very well be that a company that owns Big Studios Inc. does not have the right to do so in Germany.

Pirating content is still stealing.\n"", 'I don\'t think it is a question of ""why don\'t they allow consumers to purchase their product"" as much as it is ""is it economically feasible for them to do so."" Many companies choose to not go international with some of their products because they don\'t think there is a market for it. Plain and simple. You have to see it from their point of view. Is it worth investing in the necessary licensing agreements and avenues to allow for an international market to purchase your product even if the consumer makes up a small percentage of the population? Look at anime for instance, a small percentage of the US population actually watches anime and probably an even smaller percentage of that population probably watches the subbed versions.

6,Daviedou,"I recently read an opinion post on the telegraph (I believe - apologies if I'm incorrect) that talked about how the #metoo movement have made men afraid to ""make moves"" along with the Kavanaugh case made me think more critically about the whole movement. Up until this point I've been fairly supportive of it with few criticisms of it.I should also probably mention that I personally think the base idea/concept of the #metoo movement is simply great. Bringing attention to an issue that has for a long time been either considered taboo or been avoided. To this extent I agree with the message behind the movement. I think the men who have been exposed with good, reliable evidence deserves what they get in the aftermath.Here are my two main problems with the movement:
Firstly like the opinion post suggested I believe that men have become a lot, lot more careful about the advances they've made. Sure, it could be argued that this is good and I'd agree if that only applied to men who otherwise had intended harm or who wouldn't have understood the idea of taking it too far or men who simply disregard consent. My issue is the men who mean well, who are respectful of women and their rights, bodies, and limits. Not only do I feel personally that global movements such (mainly) as #metoo have made not only myself, but other friends a lot more scared to make moves (not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time) a lot more afraid to do so, but I know that a lot of men and women too who believe this. Between friends and myself I know women who have outright told us they don't understand why we haven't ""made moves"". I should probably also mention that before the push for movements like this and in general otherwise my friends and I as well as others I've spoken to about this are really quite confident so I wouldn't argue that we lack that.My second problem with the movement is that it can harm men who are innocent. I wouldn't ever argue in favour of a man who has committed sexual assault or god forbid rape, but I fear that men who are called out falsely on these claims stand to lose their otherwise good reputation, even if they are found not to be guilty. This second problem isn't one where I can necessarily back it up with evidence or events of this happening, yet it is my belief that this is definitely a possibility with cases of this probably already existing. In fact I remember in the past year reading about false accusations of men linked to the #metoo movement, although to be honest I couldn't at this very time (although if I can when I have a bit more time I'll try) give any examples of this, sorry.Please change my view, like I said overall I believe in the idea of making subject matters like this more open and less taboo, but I think this movement in particular can and have made men afraid and can harm them.Thank you :)","['DeltaBot', 'kublahkoala', 'Daviedou', 'kublahkoala', 'Daviedou', 'racercowan', 'KanyeTheDestroyer', 'Daviedou', 'ethan_at', 'MathBrush', 'Daviedou', 'Milskidasith', 'Daviedou', 'BolshevikMuppet', 'Daviedou', 'CoyotePatronus', 'Mite033', 'Daviedou', 'tempaccount920123', 'Daviedou', 'jazzarchist', 'Daviedou', 'haikudeathmatch', 'Daviedou', 'ProfessorLexis', 'Daviedou', 'ProfessorLexis', 'alxndrmkhl', 'Daviedou', 'CoyotePatronus', 'Daviedou', 'CoyotePatronus', 'blueandazure', 'AnActualPerson', 'blueandazure', 'AnActualPerson', 'blueandazure', 'DeltaBot', 'hastur77', 'Daviedou', 'BolshevikMuppet', 'little_bear_', 'OhhBenjamin', 'Daviedou', 'OhhBenjamin', 'miguelguajiro', 'scottevil110', 'Daviedou', 'DeltaBot', 'PreacherJudge', 'themaskedserpent']","[""/u/Daviedou (OP) has awarded 1 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", 'As a man, I know I’m much more likely to myself be a victim of sexual assault or rape than I am to be falsely accused. I’m about as likely to be falsely accused of rape or sexual assault as I am to be falsely accused of burglary or attempted murder, and being falsely accused of those crimes just doesn’t take up any of my brain space, so why worry about false rape accusations? \nWhereas I actually know and am related to men who have been sexually abused and raped — my father was raped by a priest when he was a boy, and my brother was sexually assaulted by a man in high school. This was years ago, and I’d like to think the climate now has made it so that if it happened today, they would feel comfortable reporting these crimes. The #metoo movement isn’t just about women — men are also very rarely believed when they are sexually assaulted, and #metoo is changing that perception.\n', 'I\'m sorry but I totally disagree with you. Firstly to tackle your second point - I don\'t think men are comfortable coming forward about sexual assault or rape. It\'s easy to say anyone nowadays would come forward but realistically probably not, especially as a man. I wish this wasn\'t the case but I don\'t think men are ""comfortable"" reporting the crimes, perhaps a bit more than before but not significantly.\nTo your first point, I never made the argument that being falsely accused has a higher rate of happening than sexual assault or rape, merely that the movement has made an environment where women feel as if they have enough safety behind the movement to make false accusations without repercussions.\nAppreciate your response but it certainly hasn\'t changed my mind\n', '\n, merely that the movement has made an environment where women feel as if they have enough safety behind the movement to make false accusations without repercussions.\n\nDo you have any evidence that women are doing this more frequently than before?\nI never said that men are now comfortable talking about their own sexual assault. But the fact that we’re having a national conversation about does make it easier for them to come out. The only reason I know my brother was assaulted was because of #metoo — everyone was talking about it, so my brother was like “Well, while we’re talking about it...” \nEven if feminists don’t intend for #metoo to help male victims, it does.

The other day a woman called the police on a young school boy for having touched her inappropriately on her lower back. CCTV footage shows the boy walking past him and his big school bag accidentally brushing against the lady. The lady never spoke to them prior to calling the police and never considered that maybe it wasn\'t sexually charged (i.e. an accident). If they hadn\'t had the CCTV footage in the store this boy or his mother/father could have easily been blamed for something they hadn\'t done.\nThose were just a few but I could give you more if you\'d like.\nYes you did ""I\'d hope the climate today would make them comfortable to report these crimes"" (referring to sexual assault and rape) is the words I believe you used. Coming out Vs talking about it? I\'m not sure what the difference is, could you clarify?\nI\'m glad people like your brother came out because of it, and that is one of the many many positives.\nI don\'t really like most modern day feminists for various reasons (although I strongly believe in equal rights). But you are correct I never said the metoo movement doesn\'t help men, although it mainly helps women, merely that it can also harm men.\n', 'I\'d have to scrounge up the post, but one of the side bars on a men\'s rights sub had a post about the subject of false rape allegations. Try checking out this post and tell me what you think. You can basically ignore my next paragraph if you read this.\nBasically, you\'re more likely to actually get raped as a man than be accused falsely of rape.\nMost false rape accusation seemed to be made by/at the behest of parents (i.e. ""the only way our girl could have come home late was if she was raped"", though both teens being stupid and statutory rape are real things).\nDue to the attitudes of police and stuff, a rape accusation has a good chance of being thrown out or straight up ignored even if it\'s a legitimate one.\nThe chances of you getting actually arrested and then put in jail for false rape accusations are just astronomical. The real issue is that the court of public opinion is more emotional than factual, and that\'s an issue that goes both ways. Innocent men can be robbed of their livelihood because of one vindictive person, and actual victims can have people point and laugh about their trauma because ""she\'s just a slut"".\nIn my personal opinion, the #metoo movement has done more good than harm, especially since it\'s gotten a few abusers of males into the spotlight instead of just going ""pfft men getting raped funny joke doesn\'t really happen"". While their are those who leverage it unjustly to their benefit, those sorts of people were already around and would just find something else to take advantage of.\nNow to see if I can find that subreddit I mentioned, since it actually seemed nice.\nEdit: Found it, /r/MensLib , seems to be nice. I haven\'t really spent to much time on there, but it seems to be MRA but focused on being positive and avoiding hate.\n', 'Not to mention that much of the initial success of MeToo is closely related to male victims coming out and accusing their abusers.

If you are just trying to score with many women as possible, maybe you should consider whether you are the problem #metoo is addressing.\n\u200b\nFor the second problem, men that are falsely accused by #metoo activists are likely targets for other reasons. If the #metoo movement didn't exist, the people targeting them would find other popular ways of bringing them down, like tying them to bad political opinions or accusing them of racism.\n"", ""Your first argument is a valid one but I don't really agree. I am not a big fan of the hook-up culture but I don't think it's necessarily bad (Big difference between hook-up and rape/force btw). Just like marijuana I don't like it personally but I fully support the legalisation and usage of it because of a societal and personal benefit. This comes from my belief as well that hook ups isn't men wanting it, it's women wanting it as well. It is both parties job to make sure it's consensual and okay. Granted I would agree (although not what I'm arguing) that if you need to make sexual advances quickly that your relationship perhaps isn't long term. However, even there I think maybe men are afraid. Sure if you've been together forever you won't be afraid to make advances because you're past that stage. Instead if you're in a relationship and want to (as it would be natural to do) move it forward sexually many men are afraid of doing so, even in a good committed relationship. \n"", 'First of all, with regards to making moves, you\'re being super unclear about what you\'re referring to here. You seem to mostly be talking about not asking somebody out or doing any sort of clear signal they\'re attracted to somebody else, since you say that it\'s ""not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time"", which has basically nothing to do with #MeToo. So I don\'t really understand what the link is supposed to be here; are you saying that #MeToo has gotten guys so paranoid that they refuse to even ask people out? Because that\'s certainly not something I\'ve experienced, or even heard aside from the most absurd doomsayers.\nAs far as the false accusations thing, you\'re basically being mealy-mouthed to the point of having no view. ""Some people might possibly be harmed due to false claims in some way and maybe I read something about it but I\'m not sure"" is... not a lot to go on. I\'ll just say the generic bits: There is little reason to suspect that false claims about sexual assault are an epidemic problem or significantly more likely than any other sort of false claim. The number of people who either fear coming forward about their sexual assault due to doubt in the system, or do come forward but are mistreated by the system and fail to get justice, are so much greater than the number of malicious false accusations that it\'s silly to treat the (potential) falsely accused as more important than the (actual) victims.\n', 'I realise this now, and I apologise. However, I would argue that this applies to even semi-sexual encounters - suggestive touching, hugs, kisses, etc. I think perhaps asking out isn\'t the case, more suggestive things. I think to some extent even sexual things. Men are afraid of making sexual moves with people/partners they are more confident and comfortable with as well, in fear of being judged, accused, or attacked because of it. Still you made a good point about the #metoo movement not being about ""asking out"" and whatnot, and you\'re right. I just didn\'t make it clear - sorry on my behalf.\n\u200b\nI would definitely agree that the number of people afraid of coming forward is greater than those who are falsely accused, my point is that the metoo movement has created more false accusations and men are more worried than ever about false accusations, after a quick google search there are so many articles you can find from reliable and less reliable sources backing me up on this, from cases of false accusations to men being afraid of false accusations.\n\u200b\nExamples: https://morningconsult.com/2018/10/11/a-year-into-metoo-public-worried-about-false-allegations/\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/10/17957126/himtoo-movement-pieter-hanson-tweet-me-too\nThere are more and I know the above are more opinion posts than facts (although they have statistics) but this is just the top few articles, there are more if you research. \n\u200b\nUltimately you made a good point in saying that I wasn\'t clear but you haven\'t changed my mind.

Because that’s not something they should be doing. \nIf what you mean by “moves” is “touching someone sexually without knowing explicitly that they want me to”, you shouldn’t be making those moves. Maybe that means you lose out on sex with a girl so really wants to not have to explicitly consent, but if that’s the case you dodged a goddamned bullet.\n', '\nAnd if it ruins the mood to say “do you want this”, that’s the price of doing business.\n\nI\'m a bit split on this idea. Whilst I understand it, it is also kind of shunned upon to ask for a kiss or a hug (for example after a first date) from my own experience and as others have told me.

Maybe that means you lose out on sex with a girl so really wants to not have to explicitly consent, but if that’s the case you dodged a goddamned bullet.\n\nTrue I don\'t disagree - my point isn\'t ""oh it\'s weird to ask for consent to have sex for the first time"" - obviously it isn\'t and it\'s necessary but that\'s my point - men are afraid of less sexual encounters or encounters with that aren\'t the slightest bit sexually charged. The other day for example a woman in a convenience store called the police on a boy who apparently sexually grabbed her ass or touched her inappropriately lower down her back. What actually happened and CCTV footage showed this after an investigation - the young schoolboys backpack briefly rubbed against her back as he was walking past. Obviously this boy had no intentions of even an encounter with the woman.\n', ""Was her accusation false or did she really believe it happened and was proven wrong?\nDid her 'false accuasation' ruin that boy's life? Is he in jail or ostrasized or on some sex offender registry somewhere now because of it?\nOr was it a one-off situation where she accused in good faith, was proven wrong, and nothing horrible happened to the kid as a result?\n"", '\nFirst of all, with regards to making moves, you’re being super unclear about what you’re referring to here. \nWhat i believe he is referring to is women asking why don‘t they make sexual advances. (Yes i did read the rest of your comment so i know that you pointed out that he said it doesnt always mean sexually) but this is how i took it. Ive definitely been asked why i havent made any sexual moves and its mainly because I think of myself as a gentleman and its very scary that I could be accused of something with a negative intent and i of course never have any sort of negative intention when it comes to this.\n\n', ""I would say this is not at all incorrect but I would like to clarify the distinction between sexual (sex, sexual touching, grabbing, making very sexual remarks (if you are complimenting a girl you know on a physical attribute that isn't sexual I see no reason unless she asks you to stop for that to be considered wrong) and things like hugs, perhaps a kiss after a great first date, or even for example tapping someone on the shoulder to get their attention.\n"", 'Daviedou\n\nSure, it could be argued that this is good and I\'d agree if that only applied to men who otherwise had intended harm or who wouldn\'t have understood the idea of taking it too far or men who simply disregard consent.\n\nThis middle group is the largest. The ""well meaning but dumb as bricks"" group.\n\nNot only do I feel personally that global movements such (mainly) as #metoo have made not only myself, but other friends a lot more scared to make moves (not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time) a lot more afraid to do so, but I know that a lot of men and women too who believe this.\n\nI find this hard to believe. \n1) Serial womanizers don\'t care.\n2) Introverts generally don\'t date, period.\n3) Rapists don\'t care.\nThe only people who care are the ones that know that they\'re likely to commit sexual assault while drunk or ""in the heat of the moment"", and they\'re worried they\'re gonna get caught (as they should be).\n\nPlease change my view, like I said overall I believe in the idea of making subject matters like this more open and less taboo, but I think this movement in particular can and have made men afraid and can harm them.\n\nIt\'s very simple. If you have questions, ask them. \nIf you would like to go out a date would a lady, you simply say ""Hi, my name is blank! I saw you doing [blank], and I was wondering if I could get to know you a bit better! Can I buy you a coffee sometime?\nIt\'s basically like applying for a job interview.\nIf you\'re on a dating platform, you don\'t need to be so uptight, because presumably, it puts your interests in your profile and matches accordingly.\nIf you\'re not used to dating, you can simply go the pacifist route and go join things that have hobbies that you like and see if there\'s any people that strike your fancy, and then basically feel them out.\nYou can always ask people straight up, and remember to be courteous and say ""If you\'d rather not answer, that\'s fine too.""\nAnd if they don\'t want to hang around you, just excuse yourself and leave. Then go cry yourself to sleep or go grind in a video game or something.\nBeen there, done that.\nNote: I\'m a goddamn stereotypical programmer. ""Crushing pussy"" is not something I am familiar with.\n', 'Maybe they are, maybe they aren\'t - Neither of us have statistics to argue that. As I have mentioned in many replies it doesn\'t matter if they are the largest group because there are a large minority that are also affected who don\'t have bad intentions are are as you said ""well meaning but dumb as bricks"". \nSecond point is just wrong. Rapists don\'t care, womanizers don\'t and introverts don\'t date. That\'s true. But there are men who are genuinely just afraid of being called out by women who don\'t care. Obviously if you do something really horrible or take it way too far you are in the wrong, but many times men are called out for doing something much worse when they have done something otherwise pretty harmless or insignificant. An easy ""no"" or ""please stop"" is enough and the man should respect that. If they don\'t they\'re in the wrong but women have not even said ""no"" and gone straight to blaming them of something much more heinous. I think to make the claim that the only people who care are drunk assaulters is completely false. An article I read the other day said 57% (can\'t comment right now on the validity of this but I believe it was a reliable source) of US adults are worried about false allegations towards men as they are of women facing sexual assault - are you saying 57% of US adults are drunk rapists?\nWhilst I agree with the whole question/consent thing, I would argue it is also frowned upon by society to be the weird guy who asks the woman after a great date if he can kiss her. Sure some may approve of it, but in my own experience girls who are into you don\'t want you to constantly ask what I can do, they want some spontaneity too - this is where the balance becomes very hard and men become afraid of doing the wrong thing and being blamed for ""sexual assault"" or ""rape"". But other than that I would agree with how you see the situation.\nI don\'t like online dating but I\'d agree with your statement. Yet when you meet in person there is always the question of what is right and what could be interpreted as wrong or harassment.\nOverall I\'d say you seem very smart and have some good points but I don\'t really agree with the some things relating to my actual argument/discussion-point. And yes I\'ve been there too - at least video games don\'t reject you or call you out for sexual assault ;)\n', 'Men are 230 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than falsely accused.\nIt\'s literally SOOOO easy to not be accused of sexual assault. You literally ONLY have to NOT sexually assault people, communicate honestly with others, and respect boundaries. I believe that\'s just about it.\nAnyone who is afraid is either nervous because they know their past actions warrant assault, which, FUCK them because they\'re among the worst scum who KNOW the difference and have been hurting women/others because they thought they would never be accountable. But now people are coming forward and they\'re fucking freaking out. I WONDER WHY!\nAs far as you or anyone who is afraid to ""make moves,"" you literally just have to have open lines of communication. Things like discussing before hand or, say in the midst of kissing just asking ""do you want to go farther?"" or ""would you like me to.."" or ""can I..."" and then respecting the response is SO fucking easy. Even reading body language is easy as hell and I don\'t think I buy it when people say ""they don\'t know."" I feel like these are people whose bare minimum for respect begins and ends with vocal rejection which some people are too anxious to speak up about and while they detect their partner is nervous, without those explicit words, they\'ll continue and worsen the comfort level of their partner.\nThis literally is one of those ""if you\'re innocent, you\'re fine"" situations. If you are worried of being called out in a #metoo story, you\'re either guilty and you fucking know it, or you DESPERATELY need a crash course in how to not sexually assault someone, which is fucking insane to me and also kind of suggests you KNOW what red flag behaviors are but don\'t want to give them up because they\'re all you\'ve relied on to get any action. Which is, of course, fucking horrifying. \n', 'The article is a good read and a valid point... if it related to my discussion/argument. I\'m not arguing false accusations are higher statistically than sexual assault, only that false accusations is an issue that needs tackling, and that have grown due to the metoo movement. For example I read an article (pretty reliable if I remember correctly) that cited a statistic from this year I believe saying that 57% of US adults (men and women) are equally worried about false accusations of males as they are of sexual assault. Those 57% have to, to some extent be justified in their belief. No?\nWhilst I agree with the whole ""FUCK them"" as they are some of the worst scum of earth who I wish hell upon, I don\'t agree that they are the only ones that are afraid of it. Because of the metoo movement other men have become afraid of any actions that are even semi-sexual in nature (hugging, suggestive touching (not sexual touching but maybe frequent touching for example), even kissing maybe (like first date to kiss or not to kiss situation), etc). There was even a case of a woman calling the police on a boy who ""touched her inappropriately"" (was really just a nudge on her lower back) only to later see on the cctv camera that it was his school bag (he was really young) that briefly bumped into her. It is situations like this that make people afraid of even the most mundane sexual or romantic actions or encounters.\nI can say from experience that communication is key, but I also know from experience and others that the majority of girls want some spontaneity. Like I mentioned before it is usually frowned upon if you were to for example ask if you could kiss a girl after a good first date, you either do it or don\'t. Still I agree that communication is key. Anyone who doesn\'t respect the response are genuine scum assholes who deserve hell, that doesn\'t mean that there aren\'t men who are respectful who doesn\'t get screwed over. Saying body language is easy might be easy for you to say. I think personally as well I am good at reading body language and I have been successful for the most part in my sexual or romantic/relationship endeavours but it is unfair to assume everyone is. Sure if someone is clearly uncomfortable, ignoring that is wrong, but it isn\'t always clear and it isn\'t always with partners who you have spent long periods of time with either, it could for example be first encounter (obviously sexual situations shouldn\'t occur at this time), or first dates or even after a few dates.\nIt\'s not one of those situations of ""if you\'re innocent you won\'t be blamed"" as many many men have faced false allegations with more and more becoming common and being spoken out about.\nI wouldn\'t say either of those are true, I have never gone too far and made someone uncomfortable, quite the opposite I\'ve been told to be more spontaneous and less worried about my actions (asking less if things are okay) and I don\'t either think it\'s fair to say I\'ve ignored red flags to get action. I despise rapists, sexual assaulters or people with no respect for others as much as you do.\nI think it\'s fair you have your opinion, and even if I disagree you have a right to your opinion, although your last paragraph was a little aggressive and accusatory and I didn\'t appreciate that.\n', 'Have you ever tried asking to kiss someone?  It’s the most effective “line” I’ve ever used.\n', 'Actually I have - although I ended up kissing them both times one of them initially had a bad reaction and the other paused for a moment before saying ""yes? I guess"". But hey - if it works wonders for you then props to you. I guess it depends on the girl.\n', 'I believe that, what you\'ve said here, is absolutely why some are scared about receiving an accusation of sexual assault or rape. \nYou\'ve made it clear that you believe that a woman making an accusation is only ever going to do so against a man who is definitely guilty of it. The man is either a rapist or a dummy who refuses to understand consent. \nNobody is defending rape, sexual assault, negating consent, or even push back against aggressive men. People are worried that a perfectly normal relationship will explode, because the woman has realized she has something to gain by accusing them. And there are several very infamous cases where this was exactly the case. ""Mattress Girl"" being one. \nIt would be less of an issue if accusations were made, it was investigated, guilt/innocence concluded in a trial, and everyone went on their way. But that\'s not how it works. The court of public opinions judges someone guilty immediately on an accusation being announced. The accused suffers drastic penalties, both in their career/education and socially, and if/when it eventually comes out they were innocent, the accuser suffers no consequences of their act. \nNow, I don\'t believe this is some kind of epidemic. I dont think men need to be afraid of the ""False Accusation Boogeyman"", they just need to be more selective in the women they get close to. However, insisting that women cannot make false accusations (and thus all accused are guilty) is very naive and unhealthy. \n', 'I would 100% agree and I\'m not personally afraid of the ""false accusation boogeyman"" myself but I think it\'s still an issue that the metoo movement have made a little easier to pull off and some men have become a little scared of it.\n', 'I certainly understand people being concerned. With the presumption that ""accusation = guilt"" and how institutions will eject you based on that (or for fear of public outcry if they dont), a person can be branded with a scarlet letter and have their life destroyed over something they didn\'t do and were never even tried for. \nIt certainly helps nothing that its near impossible to even talk about it, with the modern political climate as it is. You can see in my comment chain that even a moderate ""everyone gets the benefit of the doubt"" is considered unreasonable. No, people want to reverse the Blackstone Formulation of """"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer"", into something where it doesn\'t matter how many innocents are punished, so long as some are found guilty. \nThat all said;\nIn most cases that I\'m aware of, the motivation for a false accusation was either over a power struggle or a toxic relationship. So I don\'t think the average guy needs to worry about talking to women or trying to flirt respectfully.\nGenerally, I don\'t think the majority of women are the type to ever do such a thing anyways. More, I would advise people to be wary of those who are ... political extremists... and have bought into the hysteria. A woman might happily accept you buying her a drink at a bar, but someone across the room can accuse you of putting something in it, for example. \n', ""I'm a woman who's a victim of sexual abuse and while I do agree a bit with your point on how simple it is to not sexually assault people, I think we also have to factor in OPs point. \nHe's talking about false accusations and they may sound unbelievable but they can happen. I knew of some people in therapy who opened up that they were there because they were falsely accused and they were traumatized by how people joined in arms and treated them like shit for something he did not do. The problem really is just like sexual abuse/assault with women, false accusations are not really talked about that much because people will most likely not believe you. And my whole point with this is that we cannot dismiss the idea of people getting falsely accused just because we think they cannot exist. They also need our support because it's a difficult situation too because once you've been branded as one (sexual assault) even if proven wrong it will always stick with people. And just imagine having your life ruined over something false. That's definitely saddening and is disconcerting. \n"", 'Firstly I want to say how sorry I am that you had to have gone through something so horrible - I hope you had people who could help you through it and I hope you never ever have to go through something like that ever again.\nSecondly I want to thank you for corroborating my point and for honestly clarifying it a bit.

Another thing to point out is that even if 1 in 4 women are raped, that doesn't make 1 in 4 men rapists. Even then that wasn't my point. The point is that women are feeling more confident falsely accusing men because of the movement and more false accusations are coming out because of it.\nThat second argument is flawed too. If they were sexually assaulted or raped that is very very unfortunate and I wish hell on the rapist or the one who commits the assault, this doesn't mean innocents should be put in the crossfire in an attempt to charge others who are guilty. Yes women should be comfortable reporting and coming forward about rapists but not encouraged or otherwise feel safe by a movement to falsely accuse men.\nI would argue that this applies to even semi-sexual encounters - suggestive touching, hugs, kisses, etc. You'd be right in pointing out that I wasn't specific.

That whole “I’d rather let ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison” thing.\n', 'Regarding the fear of making moves: \nPretty much anytime a woman goes anywhere or does anything, she is expected to take precautions against being assaulted. Decisions like where to park, where to live, what to wear, whether we can take a walk at a specific time or place...it is expected and largely accepted that this is apart of being a woman. This is especially true when it comes to dating. While you and your friends may be cautious to ""make moves"", any woman who might be interested is calculating whether or not you seem safe enough to go on a date or be alone with. While you might fear that your well-meaning actions may be misinterpreted, women fear that you may injure, rape, or even kill them. With all this in mind, it doesn\'t seem particularly onerous to me that men may now fear ""making moves"" more than they did before. \nWith that said, I personally think it is a good thing that well-meaning men are thinking before they act and getting a new perspective on how some of their actions may be perceived by women. There are plenty of socially acceptable situations that are uncomfortable, intrusive, and even coercive towards the women involved, and the only way to avoid this is clear and open communication. I think anyone--including well-meaning men who genuinely do not want to hurt women--should consider this cultural shift a plus. \nAs for the issue of false accusations, many people have already mentioned that these are incredibly rare so I won\'t belabor the point. But even if they were more prevalent, IMO the answer to this problem is the old internet adage: don\'t stick your dick in crazy. Whether you\'re just hooking up or looking for something more long-term, its simply a matter of looking out for yourself, and if you\'re not doing it already, you should start immediately. Even before any fear of false accusations, there have always been crazy exes and jilted lovers doing crazy shit. \nComing forward with a rape accusation is an earth-shattering, life-altering thing. Getting the law involved costs money, and in the case of a false accusation runs the risk of perjury. The level of crazy involved in bringing a patently false accusation is several orders of magnitude higher than say, stealing your wallet after you fall asleep, trying to fuck your best friend, attacking you, or throwing all your shit out on the lawn--all things you should be trying to avoid in a potential partner or hookup anyway. So, in my opinion, anyone who is looking out for themselves the way they should be isn\'t all that likely to get involved with someone who is going to falsely accuse them. I think it also bears repeating here, that on the flipside, women are evaluating dates and hookups based on how likely they seem to rape, maim, or kill us. So it is hard for me to sympathize with the idea that it\'s this big, onerous thing that men suddenly feel the need to exercise good judgement about the kind of people they are canoodling with. \nEdit: added paragraph breaks\n', 'Nothing has changed regarding the law, and nothing has changed regarding what people view as right/wrong.\n', 'No, but the culture has changed for better and worse.

It can be possible that the #metoo movement both greatly reduces the prevalence of sexual assault and sometimes makes men afraid to make a move. If this is the case, the one can judge the movement based on the relative harm of each.

Who is harmed more: women who are assaulted or men who are afraid to make a move?\n\u200b\nAs a side, if this whole thing has prompted conversation between men and women like the one you described (where the women are asking ""why didn\'t you make a move - I wanted you to"") I\'d argue that is a huge plus.

Assuming that you take that answer at face value, you now know who did it, which means that you further know that a host of other things did not do it. You could further ask ""How did God do it?"" Presumably, the answer would be something like ""He works in mysterious ways."" But maybe not. Maybe the person you\'re asking has precise, detailed information about exactly how God did it.

Like my quotes above probably show by now, putting god as the author is mere speculation.

Are you saying that any explanation of black holes ""that is based on verifiable and observable science"" would be satisfactory to you?\nAs a side issue, would it be possible to phrase your interest in black holes in the form of a question to which the kind of person who would say ""God did it"" would be likely to answer in that way?\n', '\nThis statement seems to be saying that you would consider the one answer more valid than the other, but it doesn\'t say anything about whether you would consider the answer satisfactory.

8,chandadiane,"First: let me make it VERY clear that this is not a pro-assault or pro-harassment view point, nor am I saying I believe any of these men / women are lying about being assaulted.  That has nothing to do with my opinion at all.  Additionally, this is not meant to attack or shame any victim past, present or future.    This is about those who have experienced assault, knew it would hurt them professionally and did not report it when something could actually have been done about it.   A prime example of this (and certainly not the only one) would be most of Harvey Weinstein's victims.  SO many women and girls.  Scores of women spanning decades.  Most of which went on to reap the benefits of his influence later.  Actresses, Screenwriters, Models, TV Hosts, etc.    I'm betting a major reason no one spoke out about him is because they each had something to lose.  Which in this case is a career in show business.  This was their biggest pay-off (as well as an *actual* pay-off in some cases).  So they did not speak out, they kept quiet and it continued to happen.  To compound the fear and shame that comes along with a crime like this, they knew that their careers would suffer.  So they said nothing.  Some of these women have admitted that they knew it was happening or had happened to other women.  This is where the TRUE harm comes in.    But now, 20/30+ years later, after the benefits have been reaped, under the veil of strength and bravery, women are coming forward in droves crying about this injustice.  And now its a ""movement"" that we are supposed to rally behind.   Everyone of these women have failed the women that came after them.  Making it harder and harder each time for them to come forward.  The damage is done, there will be no proving this ever happened.  He has gotten away with it, and each one of the women that did not come forward helped him, and those like him.    I know, first hand, how bad it sucks to have to report a person of power who has taken advantage of me.  I know it is difficult because I've done it.  This does not make be any more of a woman and I am not looking to start a movement.  But as woman we all know that no one is going to stand up for us ESPECIALLY if we aren't willing to stand up for each other.  I said something.  I lost my job, I knew I would.  But it is my sincere hope that I made it easier for the next woman to say something and in turn making it more difficult for him to do it again.  Granted, he is not Harvey Weinstein, but that does not make my fear and shame at the time any less.     It does not help for a millionaire actress to come forward and say she was assaulted 30 years ago.  My young daughter who may look up to her cannot use that. The outcry has lost it's power.  What she NEEDS to see is women propping each other up in the NOW.  Not: this happened years ago and I have gone on to a fabulous career in the public spotlight.  This does not take his power away.  Our children often (WAY too often imo) look up to these women as idols.  Our girls are seeing what can happen if you DON'T speak up.  I speak very candidly with my children about many things we see in the media.

I agree that ideally, the Weinstein\'s of the world should be decried immediately. If you frame MeToo against that ideal world, I can see how you\'d see the movement as a net harm. You\'ve made a good case for that.\nBut that\'s not the proper frame. The proper frame would be to look at what came before MeToo: silence about abusers. The silence happened. The question is, now, how do we go forward? Given what\'s happened, I think coming forward is much, much better than never coming forward at all. Moreover, I think that coming forward later rather than never will encourage people to come forth sooner: it shows that women can be believed and makes it more clear to men that they will face social, career, or even criminal consequences for their actions.\n\u200b\nA much, much smaller quibble I have with your post:\n\nMaking it harder and harder each time for them to come forward. The damage is done, there will be no proving this ever happened. He has gotten away with it, and each one of the women that did not come forward helped him, and those like him.\n\nIt\'s true that the crimes are committed and in that sense he got away with it. But that doesn\'t mean he will get away with it in the long run. The NY DA is currently pursuing 5 charges against Weinstein. It\'s still unknown whether he will get criminally punished; it may very well be that he gets convicted and rots in jail. At the very least, his career is over and his reputation is ruined. That\'s some justice, however small.\n', ""Better late than never... maybe.  Any benefit of 30 years later is so far diminished by the blind eye turned to the victims that came after her.  That possibly knew about her and saw she shut her mouth and look! Now every teenage girl in America wants to be her and every boy dreams about her.   So they shut their mouth and the cycle continued.\nAs to the smaller quibble (I like that word, I will add it to my vocabulary)\nFive charges against Weinstein.   Five.  Last I saw, and I haven't been keeping count, 85 woman are NOW speaking out about him.  That number honestly brings a tear to my eye.  Every woman that came before the 5 that are still able to do anything should bear the guilt of all the women that came after her.  \nI mentioned in another post that what happens to him should be far less important than what happens to the five women.

I started having panic attacks thinking about stuff I thought I'd buried deep enough to never hurt over again. I don't trust men when it comes to relationships or sex, but I thought I'd be able to get past that eventually without thinking about what happened to me.\nBut it's also... good. To hear people talk about this. To hear people stand up for them. To see people support each other. I don't feel so ashamed, I don't hate myself so much anymore. I started talking about it. I know how normal it was that I froze. I might be able to get past it eventually. I might be able to have a serious relationship with a man some day.\nOn a larger scale, I think this movement's important because it's got us talking about consent. What is consent? What should it be? Should we ask people before we do things? When? When/under what circumstances should we check in with our partners?\nI trusted the first person who hurt me. And I think they really didn't/don't know what they did was wrong. I think the fact that people are talking about consent will help people do better. He should have known that it's not okay to fuck someone who isn't moving or responding to his actions. But an alarming number of men seem to really not understand that that is a time where you need to check in with your partner and make sure they're okay/still okay with what you're doing.\nAnd fuck, people need to hear that it's not okay to keep asking for things until the person you're asking says yes. And that no means no. I'm so sick of arguing with men I've told to not touch me.

My stance is that as a victim I don't find solace in someone who gained so much through silence, when there are women out there losing everything just for the chance to be heard.  THOSE are the women with the tale to tell that should be shouted as loud as possible.

I do think it is good for people to at least occasionally see sexual assault victims treated with respect, and personally, that's what made me feel like I could start to talk about my own stuff with people I trusted, including my psychologist (who I see because of other stuff, but this is also something I need to work through).\nAnd regardless, they've got us talking about consent. The aspect of MeToo that often gets attention, getting high-profile men to be held accountable probably isn't the most important part (though I do think it can be good to for men to start to know that there's a chance they won't be able to get away legally with this stuff, and that when these women are supported, I think it helps some people see that it's possible people will support them, too. I don't think I'd have entertained the possibility that I'd be able to talk to someone who wouldn't blame me for what happened to me if I hadn't seen women supported publicly when they talked about it).\nThat conversations about consent are happening is huge. It doesn't seem to get the most media attention or whatever, but I think it's because of MeToo and it is awesome, and if people both celebrities and regular people in mass talking about awful things done to them is what it takes to get people to care about consent and take it seriously, then I appreciate every single person who talks about it now, no matter how long they waited or how much or little they have to lose. People need to see how important consent is, and how awful taking advantage of others is. Everyone should know better, but they don't, so I love that these conversations are happening, even among people largely apathetic to issues of sexism.\n"", ""I've waited to reply to this because I wanted to think for a spell on one particular bit.

They are the ones who can tell other women: staying quiet takes its own toll. It rots away inside your soul. You hate yourself for not being brave, for being clueless, for being weak and gullible.\nMost women who have come out with their stories later do not claim to be brave. They claim shame, remorse, and want things to change so no one else (male or female) has to keep silence because they believe no one will listen. \n\nI cannot advise her on the choice I did not make, just like a woman who did not speak up can advise on the choice she did not make.\n\nThe more people tell their MeToo story, the more it makes victims feel less alone. If so many people have been attacked, then it's not your fault. It's not because of something you did. Sheer volume of affirmations, from reporters or people who did not report, decrease the stigma and the shame.\nA victim who did not report can definitely enlighten people about the corrosive guilt of staying silent. It's a cautionary tale. And it's brave to tell such a painful story whenever you tell it. \n\nBut she did not do was was right for his future victims.\n\nSometimes, all you can do is what you can do.

It ruined friendships because no one else who knew supported me whatsoever. That's why I didn't tell. Everyone else laughed it off who was there, so I thought I was overreacting.

9,LondonDude123,"I guess this stems from Pro Clubs being abandoned by EA Sports, while their main money-maker Ultimate Team is constantly updated. I actually have another post up on this, you can read it here if you want...Ultimate Team is a TERRIBLE choice for the Fifa E-Sports event, and it should absolutely be changed to 11v11 Pro Clubs. Here's why:-1 - Pay to win. Ultimate Team is completely governed by micro-transactions in the form of ""Packs"". Buy packs, get players, improve team, play better, win games. Its that simple. Despite EA's efforts to improve the game for people who DONT buy packs, those people are stuck earning 600 coins per match. For reference, a pack of 3 players costs 5,000 coins, one average player costs 1,500 coins. Although you can make a case saying its not pay to win, the fact of the matter is you could buy the best player on the game (98 Pele) for 5,000,000 coins (8,333 games at 20 mins per game = nearly 4 months of game time), or spend real money to have a change at getting him. THAT is inherently pay to win.2 - Player skill. Maybe player skill isn't the right phrase to use, but just bare with me. In Ultimate Team, you can only control 1 player at a time. 1 player. Of course you can set tactics and what-not, but the fact remains that a player will only ever be controlling 1 player on their team. This means that out of the 22 players on the pitch, 20 of them are under AI Control. This is not good. Period. How can Ultimate Team be a ""True E-Sport"" when the computer is making all the decisions in a game. In an 11v11, every player controls one player. This is a hell of a lot fairer, because the computer AI has no input in a game, its all down to the players.3 - Player rating. This one is a bit iffy. In Ultimate Team, you buy packs as we discussed earlier. However, AFAIK, in the E-Sports you dont. You literally have a pick of every player in the game to build a team, for free. Use whatever you want. This means all you need to do to compete is practice and be good with YOUR team throughout the year (the team which you may or may not have brought with packs), then transfer it to the E-Sports competition. For Pro Clubs, you would have to build your player, your OWN player, throughout the year. Actually building up YOUR player's stats and abilities. After that, you'd need to slot YOUR player into YOUR club's play-style. It would be a lot more tactical and meaningful.4 - Game-mode visibility. Just a small one, but Pro Clubs is dying/already dead. It NEEDS something to bring it back to life, and an E-Sports around it could be the answer. I know they did an unofficial event on Twitch a few years back, and it worked really well.There you have it. There are more points to add, but I shouldnt need to. Convince me that Ultimate Team is a better E-Sports than Pro Clubs.

10,AnyGivenDeus,"Before the 1930's, people felt no compulsion or societal pressure to buy diamond rings for the person they wanted to marry. It was the De Beers diamond cartel that invented this notion when they launched the largest (at the time) ad campaign in history to promote the idea that ""real"" men bought expensive shiny crystals for their betrothed. The ""two months salary"" idea was pitched to see how much they could get away with in terms of telling people what they should pay. Every part of the now traditional way we propose engagement and get married was designed by ad companies to make more money for De Beers and their investors. They paid their miners pennies to the dollar for what they told them were ""worthless hunks of carbon,"" went to the US, and told people that they were rare precious gems that cost thousands of dollars, and could only be found in exotic locations. The Chairman of De Beers, Nicki Oppenheimer even said that diamonds are intrinsically worthless, and all they're really selling you is a status symbol, and a feeling of doing the right thing. Diamonds are common, and have a resale value less than a fifth of what they're bought for initially. You can get more for the gold band the diamond is on than the diamond itself usually! The only reason diamonds cost so much is because of the mining monopoly De Beers has on them. They drive demand up by embargoing the supply.  My girlfriend wants the rock though, and it doesn't look like her mom and dad will give me their blessing without one.

Here me out, everyone is basically berating you with ""isnt she worth $2000(or whatever amount) to you?"". This is super disingenuous for two reasons:\n1) if your gf needed $20,000(made up figure...

I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to have to explain to all your friends and family, the whole diamond scam. \nThe nice part is that you get a ring too.

That the humans have sufficient reasoning ability as to be able to recognize and correct for false reasoning. Maybe that is too much to ask of humans but I would be interested in y'alls thoughts. What am I missing?EDIT: Great feedback everyone! I changed my view that compassion would be a more suitable companion to reason than empathy, and that some sort of mechanism for spreading the adoption of the moral framework would make it more useful.

In those frameworks, if a law could favor many people but not you, how do you  value what they feel about it?\n', 'Well, to me, for a framework or principle to be called moral, it would have to be agent-neutral, or ""universalizable"". Meaning that if I were in a comparable situation, I would also be favored. It could not be e.g. that it favors a particular group of people.\nThis kind of neutrality can usually be ensured by applying the veil of ignorance.\n', 'How would the morality of charity fit in here?

Without taking atleast one \'should\' statement as an axiom, you can\'t really come up with any moral framework because you can\'t come up with a \'should\' statement purely from an \'is\' statement.\nTake an example a rather simple moral statement ""people shouldn\'t kill other people except in self defence"". Well why not? Empathy tells us that they would prefer to be alive to dead, reasoning tells us that if people go around killing others for no reason everyone is worse off. \nHowever in both these cases, I can simply question why should I care what they prefer, or wellbeing of society. You could come up with bunch of factual statements to suggest caring about those things is beneficial but we just go in circles. For every one of those reasons, I could say I don\'t care about the consequence. It is akin to playing childish game of \'why\' - you say people should do x because y, and I say but why should I care about y?\nEventually you need to come to an \'should\' statement, that you take as given. For instance if you take \'we should improve human happiness\' as an axiom, you end up with one set of philosophies whereas if you take \'promises should be kept\' you end up with another despite identical understanding of other people and identical reasoning ability.\nThere is a really good video that explain this better than my rambling.

So with a society of 150 psychopaths a logical rule to lay down would be ""Do not kill others, and if you do either try to kill others or do kill others then the remaining have the right to kill you because you are a threat to them as well."" So just with that we have a framework that states that killing is morally ""bad"" in this situation, but not because it harms the other person, but because it can be a threat to oneself so you would want to avoid it at all costs. The same thing can be done for almost all current laws or ideas that we have today that act on a punishment system. Does the punishment outweigh the gain from the action?

On a purely hypothetical level, I agree with you. I'm atheist myself and firmly believe that religion is not needed to provide morals for the modern person, and that forming your own philosophy provides a much stronger and more comfortable sense of moral bearings than religion does. That being said, I would argue that on a larger scale it was necessary at one point. I do not believe that we, as a society, would have(note, not could have), reached the same level of understanding of morals as we have now, were it not for religion. While you may think that your morals are purely your own, I feel that the reality is that we gather these morals from the society we are raised in, and tweak them as we produce our own worldview through our experiences. This can be shown by the fact that different cultures throughout the world have wildly different moral standards due to differences in how they developed over time.\nIn short, while I agree that it is possible to form your own morals based on the listed characteristics, and think it should be done for the modern person, I also think it's important to note that on a real-world level, our moral development.\nSo, regarding your last point, I think it's possible to have happen, but it is in fact asking too much of most humans left to their own devices, starting from nothing. \n"", ""Thank you for your response. \nDo you think that religion's necessity is in the creation or the enforcement of a morality? \n"", 'I think that it\'s not necessary for either, but facilitated and accelerated both.

Secondly, they caused each ""advancement"" in morality to be applied to all people much quicker than the natural spread of ideas would facilitate.\nAt this point in time, however, I believe that religion has been taken over as a means of control rather than as a means of developing morals. Religion\'s value, in my opinion, was as a theoretical framework for distributing moral ideas, but when taken literally it has only cause problems. Modern religions, as institutions, with the advent of the internet and with society\'s basic moral principles as ingrained as they now are, now slow down moral advancement rather than accelerating it, in my personal opinion.\n', 'Religion is not necessary for either; imho.

Churches, at least in the US, are basically used as cults to indoctrinate children into being conservatives and tax shelters for various scams, frauds, abuses, etc.\n\nDo you think that religion\'s necessity is in the creation or the enforcement of a morality? \n\nPersonally, no. In fact, I usually believe that religious people are like people that complain about \'activist judges\' - they\'re angry that they\'re not getting their way, in which case, not only do they have a morality, they\'re incredibly judgmental.\nI have my own religion, but it\'s secretly the religion everyone in America worships - money. I\'m not the best disciple or prophet, but I\'m a pretty good scholar.\n', 'Humans are absolutely capable of developing a logical and consistent moral framework using nothing but empathy and reasoning. In fact several already exist! The question is, how do you reconcile competing frameworks made by different people, both of which are consistent?\nIf one person says that you should never lie, because to obscure the truth is inconsistent with the fundamental pursuit of knowledge, but another person says that lying can be okay if it makes someone happier than the truth, who is wrong? These are fundamentally competing and incompatible world views, but both come from logic and empathy.\nAnother tricky area is the extent of morality demanded by the moral framework. It would seem giving my money to charity is more moral than buying something for myself. Does that mean I can never buy anything for myself? Where is the line between being moral and being a self-sacrificing idiot? That line will vary from person to person, even if each tries to draw it from a place of logic and empathy.\n', ""I disagree that you need empathy to build a moral framework. Reasoning alone is enough.\nIf your moral framework must have empathy, then it isn't something that everyone can follow or come up with to the same degree. Reason alone is sufficient for developing a moral framework. \nDo you accept that some things (like kicking a puppy, maybe) are definitely immoral? If so, then you believe that there is an objective morality. If morality is objective, then deriving/discovering it won't depend on subjective experiences, emotions, and so on. It will only depend on objective knowledge and/or reason. \nEdit: Also, if you believe that there is not an objective morality, you should still see that moral frameworks can be built with reason alone. Many philosophers have indeed done this. I'm not much of a philosopher so I could be wrong in this but I believe one such philosopher was Kant, who derived guiding moral principles from logic alone\n"", ""While I don't think there is objective morality, I would also argue that not everyone has an equal ability to reason, therefore running into the problem of paragraph 2.

The language game of what is under what is not central.\n', ""Isn't it possible to create a moral framework without empathy or reasoning? It might be an incoherent framework that lacks legitimacy, but it could still qualify as a moral framework.\n"", 'Do I really need to say a ""coherent and legitimate"" moral framework? I see what you are getting at but to not imply those things would make even less sense than to spell them out.\n', ""I don't think you would need to spell them out but I do think the observation is important. Your question seems to suggest that the problem people have with morality is that they struggle to develop systems. I think the problem people have is not that they struggle to develop systems, but rather that they struggle with determining the legitimacy of the various systems. It isn't that people struggle to conceive of a moral framework, it is that they struggle to justify why they should follow it.\n"", ""This is a great response that I was not expecting. I agree that justifying why people should follow the morality is more difficult than just conjuring one up. I don't know if the answer to that challenge lies outside of reason and empathy though... Your thoughts?\nCould stories be necessary?\n"", ""Stories are a good way of teaching a moral system. I don't know if a moral system's purpose should be the adherence of as many people as possible. So it isn't about teaching people to follow a moral system. The difference is subtle, but the goal should be justifying why one moral system is correct. It is unlikely that we will ever be able to definitely do this. So on one hand you can use reasoning and empathy in order to get people to follow a particular moral system. However, since there is a transcendent nature about Good and Bad you cannot use reasoning and empathy in order to create a system that enables people to act morally.\n"", '\nHowever, since there is a transcendent nature about Good and Bad you cannot use reasoning and empathy in order to create a system that enables people to act morally.\n\nThis is where we part ways, but I appreciate the discussion.\n', 'there\'s no value in considering invalid, incoherent, or illegitimate ""moral systems"".\n', 'Of course not, the value is in being able to determine which singular moral system is the one that is not invalid and illegitimate. The struggle with moral systems is not that they are difficult to formulate but rather hard to justify. I was challenging the OPs position that the formulation of a moral framework somehow represents anything important. You can use empathy and reasoning to develop a moral system but have not explained how it is better than a framework that is on its face ridiculous.\n', ""What I don't see in your response is anything about how you would determine the validity or legitimacy of any proposed moral system. They can't be justified until you have a standard against which to evaluate them; and that is missing from your comments.\nMoral systems should be evaluated by how the prevent harms while facilitating flourishing and welfare; that's my standard.\nWhat's yours?\n"", 'That is basically my own argument against the OP. They didn’t provide any way to establish the legitimacy of any system but assumed it legitimate regardless.\nI disagree with you that the system needs to come first. Before you have a system you need to establish what the nature of good and bad actually are. Without that things like, “preventing harm while facilitating flourishing and welfare” is nothing more than a preference or opinion.\nPersonally I exist in a kind of inconsistent duality. I believe that Good and Bad can only be established through the transcendent. Thus, I follow religionn in order to establish my own morality. Although I view that as legitimate I also recognize it as being to a certain degree irrational. So I simultaneously believe that morality is not something which can exist objectively and take on a nihilistic position.\nBut my point wasn’t to promote my own unstable view of morality. My point was to present the very question you asked me to the OP in order to make them reconsider their position.\n', 'No. Preventing harm is not a preference or opinion; or need not be. Physical injury, theft, oppression, threats; these are reasonably objective and constitute a good definition of the harms to be prevented. Knowing that is the beginning and not mere preference.\nI think the OP was reasonably clear at what they were going for, which implies a  valid answer to the ""legitimacy"" question.\n', 'But why is harming someone bad? What principle are you using to establish something as bad? The collective desire of a bunch of people wishing it were true doesn’t make it so. I can judge someone who is committing harm and also acknowledge that it is a merely preference of mine that people do not do harm. I can say that harming people results in undesirable thing X or Y, but I haven’t established why X or Y is bad other than that we have a preference to avoid it.\nYou seem to have read something into the OP’s answer which I did not. What was the clear thing they were going for?\nAlso, the opinion that no moral system can be valid, and if one was then it had to be through God, as I outlined in my last post was a legitimate answer to the validity question.\n', ""Can good or bad be practically universal without being literally universal? If you as me what time it is, I can give you the most exact answer possible, but it will be literally impossible for me to tell you the exact time because of time itself is infinitely divided.\nI don't think there is one literally universal morality, but humans have enough in common with each other that well being and needless suffering are practically universal and when combined with empathy and reasoning, legitimate morality can arise.\n"", 'If enough humans were in practically universal agreement that rape is morally acceptable than would that make rape moral? \nWhen we think about Good and Bad we do view them as constant even if no one is actually advocating for them correctly. So you can act badly, have everyone think you are good, but still have done something wrong. Tying morality to the common desires of some population makes it possible to justify anything as morally acceptable.\n', 'Raping your wife is only recently regarded as bad thing. Almost no moral framework, including the Abrahamic religions specifically forbid having a man having sex with his wife without consent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape There is nothing metaphysical to ground morality in.

Without taking atleast one \'should\' statement as an axiom, you can\'t really come up with any moral framework because you can\'t come up with a \'should\' statement purely from an \'is\' statement.\nTake an example a rather simple moral statement ""people shouldn\'t kill other people except in self defence"". Well why not? Empathy tells us that they would prefer to be alive to dead, reasoning tells us that if people go around killing others for no reason everyone is worse off. \nHowever in both these cases, I can simply question why should I care what they prefer, or wellbeing of society. You could come up with bunch of factual statements to suggest caring about those things is beneficial but we just go in circles. For every one of those reasons, I could say I don\'t care about the consequence. It is akin to playing childish game of \'why\' - you say people should do x because y, and I say but why should I care about y?\nEventually you need to come to an \'should\' statement, that you take as given.

12,notshinx,"Following is a direct quote from the 2016 Republican Party Platform:There is certainly a need to protect certain species threatened worldwide with extinction. However, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) should not include species such as gray wolves and other species if these species exist elsewhere in healthy numbers in another state or country. To upset the economic viability of an area with an unneeded designation costs jobs and hurts local communities. We must ensure that this protection is done effectively, reasonably, and without unnecessarily impeding the development of lands and natural resources. The ESA should ensure that the listing of endangered species and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of compliance and the rights of property owners. Instead, over the last few decades, the ESA has stunted economic development, halted the construction of projects, burdened landowners, and has been used to pursue policy goals inconsistent with the ESA — all with little to no success in the actual recovery of species. For example, we oppose the listing of the lesser prairie chicken and the potential listing of the sage grouse. Neither species has been shown to be in actual danger and the listings threaten to devastate farmers, ranchers, and oil and gas production. While species threatened with extinction must be protected under the ESA, any such protection must be done in a reasonable and transparent manner with stakeholder input and in consideration of the impact on the development of lands and natural resources.It is stated above that that the endangered species act ""should not include species such as gray wolves ... [since they] exist elsewhere in healthy numbers."" This is the equivalent of saying 'not my problem' in response to the fact that wolves are heavily negatively impacted by human development.Wolves are an important part of the natural North American Deciduous Forest and Evergreen Forest ecosystems. They control the populations of numerous mega-fauna such as deer, moose, elk, caribou, etc. They are much more influential than coyotes and are also less dangerous: of the 3 aggravated encounters between humans and wolves in the US in 2017, two involved the mishandling of captive wolves and one was during a dogsled race in the middle of nowhere. None were fatal. It is generally my understanding that the main fear of the recovery of north american wolf population and territory is due to threats to livestock and people. However, even that is not necessarily reasonable: in areas that have wolves, less than 5% of non-harvesting livestock deaths were due to wolf attacks; 80% were due to diseases. If Republican policy on wolves was specifically in the interest of farmers, they would be devoting more attention towards giving american farmers funding for infrastructure and antibiotics that can help improve the farms' sanitation. In addition to this, deer and other wolf prey constantly pose a threat to the crops of plant farmers, a problem to which a recovery in the population of wolves could be extremely beneficial.In 2017, congress voted for and passed the joint resolution bill H.J.Res 69, which voids a US Fish and Wildlife Service rule that prohibits the hunting of wolves and grizzly bears in Alaska. There are now no rules prohibiting the hunting of any such animals, even cubs/pups or pregnant mothers, in reserves in Alaska.These attacks on endangered species which are vital to their ecosystems is less an act in the interest of farmers and ranchers and more for the purpose of keeping oil and gas lobbyists on their side and donating their billions of dollars of potentially illicit soft money to super PACs that help Republicans run successful re-election campaigns.Note: this account is not a throwaway account, I just made a new account several days ago to replace my previous Reddit account.Note 2: a majority of my statistics come from Wikipedia.

This means that their numbers have rebounded to a significant degree, and in some places they are even reaching overpopulation numbers causing lots of issues in their habitats and endangering other species. There is absolutely no reason to keep the bans on hunting them if they are no longer on the endangered species list. \nAlso economically banning hunting costs a lot of money to enforce. It is actually better for the economy to allow the hunting. This is because you sell hunting tags, the hunters can also sell the pelts and sometimes the meat. Allowing reasonable amounts of hunting is a boost to the environment and the economy. \n', 'They are however still nonexistent in vast swaths of land. It is important that before they are hunted they are reintroduced to places that they have vanished where they used to play the important role of apex predator. \nHowever, what you said made me consider hunting.

I do not believe that there would exist a market for wolf meat, and the overall benefit to the economy from the trade of pelts seems like it would remain far less than the role those wolves can play in regulating ecosystems and reducing the numbers of pest crop eaters such as deer. \n', 'The endangered species list pertains to global populations, as well as extremely large regions such as all of North America. You are correct that they may not be in high population in a specific park or a specific county, but in total they have increased in population enough to get off of the list and to dangerous numbers in some regions. If a specific sub-region needs to protect populations they can simply limit tags in a given year. They do this all the time with the more commonly hunted species. \nI am also wondering why you think that the hunting would be without a check? We do not allow the hunting of anything else without a check. Everything we hunt in modernity has some kind of limiter. Either a hunting season, hunting tags limits, or specific person limitations such as subsistence hunting designations issued to some remote settlers and Native American Tribes that are limited by the small number of people that qualify for them. \nAnd the tags are a part of the economics. Billions of dollars are collected every year for wildlife preservation via the sale of hunting tags. \n', 'Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/cdb03b (182∆).\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n', ""I'm going to counter your argument with a disadvantage rather than a logical critique and then ask you to weigh the benefit between our two viewpoints (mine being that this issue should be handled locally except in the case of extremely endangered species).\nAll wildlife protection causes otherwise usable land to remain undeveloped. That is the definition of protection. If it weren't preventing usable development, then it wouldn't be protection (it would just be the status quo).\nIn North America, the development of wilderness often impacts the housing market - either by directly - by increasing the cost of land within the vicinity of a given population center. Otherwise usable land remains undeveloped, limiting supply in the market and increasing cost.\nIf the overall cost of land for dwellings increases, then the cost of housing will increase. There is no way for the government to avoid that. Even if the government completely socialized the housing market, the increased opportunity cost would still exist, which increases cost for the government.\nA good practical example of this are the extensive laws that exist in California about 'scenic views', which are directly responsible for the housing crisis along the coast. Put quite simply, if population increases and you aren't allowed to build any more rooms... then the cost of housing will increase and a lot of people will go homeless.\nTherefore, I think that non-extremely-endangered species should be handled on a case by case basis. In some instances, will the effect on the housing market be minimal? Of course, and in those instances the local government should try to preserve the ecosystem. In other instances, is the wolf population sitting on a parcel of land that could otherwise be used to build a 3,000 person apartment complex that would help keep a lot of people out of homelessness? Probably. And in that case, the local government should have the freedom to decide what happens.\n"", ""While I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment here, can't the wolves just be relocated?

The roles that a particular gender plays and the norms for that gender in society ARE socially determined, but that is not the same thing. \n', ""\nIn transgender context, gender sounds to be what the individual feel (/mentally perceive) they are.\n\nThat's what they are trying to redefine gender as. But there's no evidence that gender is not a biological phenomenon, indistinct from biological sex. \n"", ""I would like to understand a little more about your statement.\n\nin my imagination, I'm always male (anatomically) and I mentally perceive myself as a masculine persona \n\nOne possiblity - you have a delusion and you are confusing imagination with reality.  But it seems you are rational, and that is not the case.\nThe second possibility is, it seems to me, that you heavily buy in to gender stereotypes.  You were born with a female body.  I would like to understand - what does it mean that you  feel male? Or that you don't feel female?  Biologically, you have no way of knowing how a male actually feels or perceives, so all you can rely on is stereotypes of what a male should feel like.  Similarly, if you don't feel like a female - how do you know? You are biologically female and you feel a certain way.  Who is to say that is not how a female should feel?  It seems the answer is more properly phrased - I don't feel like a stereotypical female, rather more masculine which seems to me to be more stereotypically male, so I would like to be thought of (with regard to gender) as male in line with the stereotypes of what a male is.\nThe point is - fine if you want to identify as male or female or whatever.  But in some ways this is a step backwards.  Instead of breaking down stereotypes, this whole multiple pronoun movement is reinforcing it.  The whole idea is male and female identify a certain set of (stereotypical) characteristics, and I am not bound to be characterized that way based on birth.  If we really want to destroy the male/female stereotypes I think we should do the opposite - proudly say my gender is female and I can be more stereotypically masculine than males. If enough people are willing to do that, we can (slowly) erode the stereotypes that push people to self identify away from their biological sex.\n"", ""Haha, when you isolate it out like that, it definitely sounds wacky and delusional. \nHave you ever imagine yourself do something in a fictional/fantasy context? Like, imagine yourself slaying dragons/going on adventures/etc? I do have an overactive imagination, but I always imagine myself with a male avatar is what I mean. \nI have no delusion that that is in my imagination, though. \nIn real life, it's more like, I don't feel a sense of belonging when I'm with a group of female/women. In terms of shared interests, communication style, conversational topics of interest and whatnot. I have to consciously put on a farce and if I just speak my mind, I'd get stares or giggles on how different I am. Whereas when I'm with a group of males/men, I easily contribute to the conversation, I like a lot of the same things they do and we don't have much communication barrier. It's an intuitive sense of belonging and camadery that I can't quite put into words. \nI completely agree that multiple gender/pronoun movement is reinforcing gender stereotypes, but I feel like there are enough individuals who enjoy belonging to binary genders and adhering to the stereotypes that abolishing stereotypes will do more harm than good. Not to mention saying you're a woman but then going on to rebel against everything that traditionally defines a woman feels a bit like saying you're Christian, but don't believe in Christ. \n"", 'In my mind, and I can\'t speak for someone else, I can\'t see myself making the jump in logic.  I don\'t see myself ever thinking ""I am more comfortable among men, so therefore, I most be a man.  It seems less disingenuous to me to just say ""I am a woman who happens to be more comfortable among men.""  I think religion is different because it is defined by belief in a set of ideals and beliefs.  This only works for gender if you also define gender by certain beliefs and ideals (ie. stereotypes). \nAlso, imagine doing this with race.  I am white.  There is no way for me to go out and say ""From now on I am black because, based on my perception of what Black people should be like, I feel like I am one of them.""  There is no way to make that statement without actual or borderline racism involved.  In the same way, the gender argument seems inherently sexist. \nAs for whether stereotypes are useful or should be abolished that is a different conversation.  But we should certainly try not to generalize as much as we do.  \n\nNot to mention saying you\'re a woman but then going on to rebel against everything that traditionally defines a woman feels a bit like saying you\'re Christian, but don\'t believe in Christ. \n\nAs I mentioned before this is not a great comparison, as religion is (by definition) a set of beliefs.  Sex (and its related gender) should not create an assumption of certain beliefs (even if it traditionally has).  And even if there are some statistical generalities, it should not be subscribed to the individual.  So it is perfectly fine to say - in this respect, I am different than most women.  \nGiven that virtually all the people I know who feel passionately about this issue are heavily progressive in their thinking about gender, I just keep finding it hypocritical.  On the one hand, they are adamant that there are no gender differences and they argue vehemently over the pay gap, rape culture, discrimination, etc...  On the other hand, they say - I no longer want to be thought of as a woman.  Wait, what? I thought there is no difference between the two?  Which way is it?  Do we want to destroy the differences or do we want to entrench them?\n', 'I agree with what you say. I guess the final question is does sex=gender or not? In my opinion, sex does not define gender (ie, correlation is not causation). Sex is the equivalence of race in the sense that you\'re born with it and you\'d have to undergo some procedures to modify what you have. \nSo, if sex =/= gender, what does that leave gender and how can someone define gender? If I have little, except biology, in common with others who identify as women, why should I call myself a woman? Biology itself is well encompassed by ""female"" (which I will never reject unless I get FtM surgery) but unless I want to take it a step further to act in ways society would expect from ""woman"" why should I make ""woman"" a part of my identity? \nI think it\'s more... accepting that most people do identify strongly as either woman or man. They can be masculine women, feminine men and what not... but they still identify as men or women. I personally do not understand what it means to identify as a gender (gender, not sex) and the closest I can get is if people identify as a gender because they ascribe to the stereotypes/beliefs associated with that gender. \n', 'So why have separate identifiers? \nLet\'s just go back to the original - Male/Female; Man/Woman; He/She are all based on sex not gender.  It is BECAUSE you want to ascribe to it more than just biology that you feel inclined to have a second definition.  But wouldn\'t it be better if we just make it simple, if someone calls me a woman it is because I have female genatalia, and it is not making a statement about my place in society or my beliefs or what norms I ascribe to.\nThis is why I don\'t like identity politics.  It\'s come to the point where you can\'t just see a person for who he is. Rather, there is this pressure to assign each person to various groups.  I am not just Jon. I am Jon, a black, Christian, homosexual, male gendered, liberal, democrat.  It\'s gotten to the point where we want or need to identify everyone with a group. And since people don\'t fit neatly into groups, I must therefore, subdivide my group into sub-groups.  (And it gets worse when you identification with groups alone is confused with authority - A good friend often says to people - I will not respond to any argument that starts with the phrase ""As a [   ] person, I....""  Only when it starts with ""As a person who has studied this issue, I...."")\nMaybe this need to associate/dissociate from certain genders (rather than just say ""call me by my biology"") seems to be a function of the pendulum swinging very heavily to group and identity politics.  I think most people who are of the opinion that ""people are people and everyone is different"" don\'t really care what you identify as.  They just get frustrated because it seems silly at best and hypocritical or patronizing at worst.\nI mean - Do we really need to get up and shout ""I am a HE"" to get the point across that ""I may have been born a female, but please do not assume that every single thing you associate with being female 100% describes me or my beliefs?""  For any thinking (non-super sexist) person, this is obvious. So why state it?\n', 'If woman means and ONLY means that I have female genitalia, then yes, I can definitely swing with woman. Ultimately, I will never disagree with what is literally my anatomy. However, it does not seem like sex=gender in our society. If you make it a point to identify yourself as a woman, people will make assumptions that they\'ve lumped with the identifier ""woman"" and that\'s exactly what I want to avoid by not identifying as a woman.\nI really like the point you make about people who view others as individuals won\'t care about identifiers, though. Ultimately, there are horribly sexist people in the world and they\'re not going to give a shit about how you identify yourself anyway.

""I have this percentage of stereotypically masculine traits and this percentage of feminine traits so I must be ___-gender,"" is a really strange thing to say by someone who wishes to remove themselves from a gender designation. If you really wanted people to stop treating you like a certain gender, stop identifying your personal characteristics by gender. Having a job isn\'t masculine and liking fashion isn\'t feminine. Playing sports isn\'t masculine and dancing isn\'t feminine. They\'re just things that people do because they enjoy doing them. \n\nI mostly present and act as a cisgendered woman because it suits my purposes and makes life easier\n\nThis is probably the part of your post I have the most problem with. Why should you as an individual be able to always act in a way that is the most momentarily convenient? My bathroom at the bar is disgusting but the women\'s bathroom is always nice. It would be very convenient to me to use the women\'s bathroom but I can\'t because I have a dick. But you\'re saying you should be able to just cancel your woman subscription and switch to man even though you\'re anatomically female. Life isn\'t convenient and you are who you are so just be who you are and stop making gender such a big deal when the reality is that people only actually care about your biological sex.\nThis differs drastically from religion because religion is literally something you can decide not to believe. Gender is simply a set of stereotypes that are foisted upon people of a certain biological sex, but religion is a belief system you have to choose to believe. I choose to be Jewish because I believe in (most of) the religion and can find common cause with my fellow Jews. I\'m also a man and a male, but I don\'t necessarily agree with the majority of men. Your view suggests that because I willingly call myself a man, I must merely be an amalgamation of masculine traits, when in reality I\'m my own individual with my own beliefs, desires, and preferences. I\'m not a man, I\'m /u/slenderpman just like you\'re not a female, you\'re /u/Anonia_Prime.\n', ""I really like your post. My issue with not identifying as a woman is mostly because I don't feel a sense of belonging when I'm with a group of women/females. I feel ostracized when I'm with a bunch of women/females. A recent example - Four female coworkers and I were talking about safety at night. I casually mentioned that I'm not afraid to walk by myself at night and if anyone starts harassing me, I will punch them in the face and pull out a self-defense weapon. Wrong thing to say, in every way, when you're with a bunch of women/female but my male/men friends mostly agree that that's what they've done.  \nTo be brutally honest, a lot of stereotypes are true and it's also what females bond over. That's why I think gender is something like religion. It's a set of taught principles that individuals feel a sense of euphoria when they successfully practiced it in the way they want. In the above example, the women are likely more-so seeking affirmation and emotional validation that yes, it's so dangerous/omg, it's hard to be a woman/etc that they can bond over and hence validate themself/sense of belonging.\nRegarding my presentation, I guess you bring up the good point that I present myself as a woman and logically should expected to be perceived as one. To be fair, I personally don't care if a male uses the female bathroom.  \nOn a personal level, how is gender not an innate belief system, though? I am not speaking from personal experience, but from what I hear, individuals experience gender euphoria when they perform an action they associate with their gender (this is part I believe is a belief system) and then receives validation/positive feedback. \nI'm slightly confused by the part where you explicitly called yourself a man, then explicitly said you're not a man.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n"", ""What I meant by that last part is basically exactly how I'm going to respond to this. I mean that I am a man but not because my actions are masculine, but because I have a penis and I make no separation between sex and gender. Thinking like how I do means that the only differences between men and women are those that are biologically built in, like sexual roles in reproduction. Other than in that instance where nature intended a functional binary, there are no actions that are inherently masculine or feminine, only labels that society has incorrectly attributed to one or the other sex.\nI'm sorry you have trouble finding a connection with other women (again I equate this to females), but that, to me, is largely a symptom of your personality and who you spend time around. One of my best friends is a straight, cis woman and most of her friends are guys, but just because she can better bond with guys over her interests and personality doesn't make her a guy. In fact, I don't attribute her choice of friends to be anything gendered, just that the people whose personalities she meshes well with happen to have penises while she does not.\nThe stereotype situation is also quite a case of chicken and egg. Are the stereotypes inherently true or has society purposefully molded women's personalities to act one way and mens to act another? Gender roles were established long before sports, fashion, or even in regards to the safety of walking alone at night. I find it to be wrong that we still stick to ancient gender roles even though our society is structured in a way that could allow people to choose their personality traits a la carte versus from a man set and a woman set. \n\nOn a personal level, how is gender not an innate belief system, though? I am not speaking from personal experience, but from what I hear, individuals experience gender euphoria when they perform an action they associate with their gender (this is part I believe is a belief system) and then receives validation/positive feedback.\n\nBecause the sense of euphoria from relating to another person doesn't come from a shared experience of gender, but one of biological sex. I'm not safer walking alone at night because I like sports, the color blue, and red meat, but because I was biologically built, like other males, in a way that allows me to protect myself better than a very slight woman could. There are plenty of women who could kick my ass I'm sure, but that doesn't make them manly, just stronger than me as an individual.\n"", 'Do you believe that males and females are biologically identical?\n', ""Absolutely not. I believe in biological binary for humans. There are anatomical differences, hormonal differences and I even believe in a brain differences.  \nBut I don't believe that all biological females are women (gender) even if they are not transgender. I feel like gender is something like religion. Let's say you're female.

In fact, I\'m not sure when it became de riguer to discuss our sex life so matter of factly but it was always the rule to keep that sort of thing private in the first place.\n\ngender is more or less how you feel?\n\nNo, that\'s how it\'s been twisted by ideologues. Gender has a definition and ""how you feel"" isn\'t part of it. It\'s unfortunate that so many people have completely and utterly misused the term to advance their rather nebulous agenda based on a need to rebel.\nHere, for example, let\'s talk about somebody who feels that they\'re ""pink gender"" (I think I\'m making that up but lately I wouldn\'t be surprised to find out it\'s actually accepted by somebody)\nSo what exactly is ""pink gender""? What defines ""pink gender"" and how is it distinct from any other gender? What are the traits that somebody could distinguish about a ""pink gendered"" person? If ""I like pink"" is part of the answer then that has nothing at all to do with gender. This is usually what I see being passed off for justification of some new ""gender"". It has nothing at all to do with gender and does absolutely nothing whatsoever to help me register the term. \nGender is supposed to mean that there are a host of generally applicable traits and characteristics that apply to the two historically recognized genders. Some traits are shared while others are generally relegated to one specific gender and still others that don\'t seem to apply to either.\nWe apply these genders to the sexes for the simple reason that they\'re based on sexual differences. Men and women aren\'t the same. When I was a teenager it was all the rage to claim that men and women were actually the same. Then somebody tried to prove it and it resulted in some deaths. So that went out the window but we did realize that there is such a thing as a male brain and a female brain even if the evidence wasn\'t all that conclusive.\nWhen it comes to how people perceive you, they do it by the obvious physical characteristics they see in front of them. You can call yourself whatever you want but our society and culture was based on a gender binary for the entirety of its history. Every culture on earth is the same. So, when you say you feel like a male, you\'re going to have to at least prove it. Moreover, it\'s a contradiction to claim that males and females don\'t exist as genders while simultaneously claiming to feel like the one you\'re physically not. \nNobody expects you to conform to gender stereotypes but we do expect you to deal with reality. If you want to consider yourself male, that\'s fine but don\'t ask anybody else to play along if you\'ve got wide hips and breasts. They can see you\'re not male. Further, for you to make the claim that you\'re male, you\'d have to know what it feels like to be a male. But you can\'t know that. Even with surgery and hormones, you can never know the male experience because your entire history has been framed in the context of being a female.\nWhy not simply be you? We don\'t expect you to act in ways that we\'d generally define as male or female. You can be a woman who does all the stereotypically male things, whatever they are. But you can\'t claim to be anything but female because your sexual organs have set that in stone. With reassignment surgery we\'d call you a male. If you can do really good work with make-up, we\'d probably mistake you for a male but we\'ll never accept you as a male with breasts and wide hips because, by definition, those are female sexual traits.\n', 'The more or less encompasses why I think gender is something akin to religion. It’s “a host of generally applicable traits and characteristics.” Males and females who more or less conform bond over the traits they share with other males and females to create the gender divisions of men and women. \nActually, I would need to believe that men and women are actual genders before establishing that I feel like I belong to neither group. \nBut proving gender is more or less the same as proving religion. How can you establish that you’re “Christian enough” or “really Christian”? Even for a cisgender individual, how you can prove that you’re man/woman enough? If you can’t define clear standards, then doesn’t it more or less boil down to how an individual arbitrarily identifies herself or himself (that’s how they feel)? Unless you want to argue that sex=gender, in which case, then all women (gender) will have something in common. Other than biology and anatomy, you probably can’t find anything else all cisgender women (gender) definitely have in common. \nGender isn’t between male vs. female, though. More like, female vs. women. It’s counter-productive to call a female human a male, but just because she’s female doesn’t mean she identifies as or with women (as defined by gender and commonly shared experiences based on gender). The lack of identification is more so in terms of communication style, values and beliefs and general interest. \nBy being ostracized by men for not being male and by being ostracized by women for generally different interests/communication style/beliefs and values is exactly why I think it’s valid to be able to not identify as a man or a woman. \n', '\nI’m easily allowed to identify as atheist or agnostic, what’s so different about identifying as agender or genderqueer? If people don’t automatically assume someone is Buddhist because they’re Asian why would you assume someone is a woman because they are female?\n\nWhile I agree with your post as a whole, i disagree with this part of it. These associations come from societal factors: while there may be a correlation between being Asian and being Buddhist, it is far, far weaker than the correlation between being female and being a woman. While there’s certainly nothing wrong with being female and not a woman, the fact that such a large percentage of females are women mean that people are going to make that assumption. \n', ""I am inclined to agree with you for the most part, but I think that your comparison between assuming religious identity and assuming gender is a bit off-base.\nI'm perfectly fine with everybody identifying as whatever gender, but I also don't see any problem with assuming somebody is cisgender and adjusting my behavior in the future if they tell me otherwise, while I don't really make any assumptions about religion. This is because being cisgender is far more common than being any specific religion, and because unlike with religion, what gender somebody identifies has some impacts on how I act (most notably with pronoun usage). The chances of causing offense or distress by assuming most people are cisgender are far lower than the chances of causing offense or distress by asking everybody their gender upfront.\n"", ""To be clear, you're anatomically female but you can't really identify as male.

15,cabbagery,"A sport is, on my view, a physically demanding competition (team or individual) which has all of the following features:A purely objective scoring systemJudgment by officials is unavoidable, but the score itself is objectiveSpontaneous (reactive) aerobic activityNon-repetitive motion, motion which cannot be easily simulated (e.g. rowing machine), and actions taken by opponents materially affect one's own actionsNo mechanical, chemical, or biological implements more complicated than a simple leverProtective equipment is allowed, but machines, animals, and e.g. gunpowder are not; bats, rackets, paddles, etc. are allowedDirect concurrent competition between participantsStoppages in play are acceptable, but during play participants do not take turns (e.g. golf); team events need not include all members at all timesI believe this is the condensed form of my definition of 'sport.' The idea is to distinguish various forms of competition, separating out table games (poker, chess), races of any type (running, cycling, rowing, horse racing, car racing, skiing), and pageantry (figure skating, talent competitions, synchronized swimming), while preserving certain key competitive events as proper sports (basketball, football, soccer, water polo, tennis, volleyball, etc.).In the process, it is unclear whether baseball remains a sport (I tend to think it fails to satisfy some of the criteria, but it is very close), but boxing very clearly fails.So my view is that boxing is not a sport, nor is NASCAR, nor any type of race. I hold that a true sport does not entertain pageantry (boxing and the differing opinions of the judges), nor does it rely on machines/animals/chemicals (auto racing), nor is it turn-based, nor are one participant's actions partitioned from another's.Change my view?Edit: Many have wondered as to the motivation behind this CMV. First, it is meant as an exercise in conceptual analysis, and one which is presumably pretty innocent, so nobody gets too upset regardless of positions held. Second, it is an exercise I have undertaken in the past, and I was curious to see how and if my view could change in this forum/format (and it has, somewhat).But a third motivating factor occurred to me moments ago. When I was in high school (a very long time ago), I was a member of my school's rifle team. We competed with other schools' teams in the region with match-grade .22 rifles at 50-foot targets across four positions. It turns out that all of our matches were home events, but that is because the other schools only had access to outdoor ranges, and my school had access to an indoor range, and other schools happily relinquished their home-field advantage for a weather-free range with a wood stove, etc.At any rate, I was sufficiently skilled to earn a letter -- but not a sports letter. My school deemed rifle team as a 'club' or 'extra-curricular activity,' rather than a sport.Now, this is no skin off my back, as I didn't care then and I certainly don't care now, and no, I did not bother with a letterman's jacket (I did buy a stupid class ring, but I just got a stone I liked, and put stuff on it that I liked...).But this does matter. Title 9 means that sporting events must be offered equivalently for the two sexes. Scholarships are awarded according to sporting events, and these are required by federal law to apply across several 'sports,' however they happen to be defined.So while in my case this is an amusing exercise, it is not as meaningless as some of you think, at first glance. Whether or not a competitive event should count as a sport is a real delineation that schools in particular must draw, and it impacts students in measurable ways. Sure, we all agree that football or soccer are sports, but should we accept competitive eating? Where and how do we draw the line?This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Your school didn't support the rifle club as a sport, it doesn't make it less of a sport. Yeah I lettered as a football player in college, however after spending time with a league of legends club we turned it in to eSports competing in CSTAR league as well as even getting out school to offer partial scholarships to play for our school. They were the same value as some of the lower end sports scholarships there. \n"", ""My edit was a bit of an epiphany, in recalling some minor drama in high school, where some of my teammates were dismayed that they would not receive a sports letter. It never mattered to me, but in terms of collegiate sports and associated scholarships, that distinction -- whether a given activity counts as a 'sport' and thus receives Title 9 protection plus scholarship opportunities, etc. -- is relevant, and significant.\nSchools (or the NCAA more broadly) have to pick and choose which activities will count as sports, and their criteria are thus worth discussion. I don't mean to suggest that you think otherwise, but clearly others find this CMV to be silly (and I, myself, referred to it in such a way). It is an amusing exercise for me, but it is also important in some contexts. I confess I don't know the right lines to draw (hence the CMV), but I don't think my view is so far removed from that which is appropriate, (minor) changes to date notwithstanding.\nIf it is easy to get a school to offer scholarships for activities such as your LoL club, I salute you and congratulate you, but I worry that the scholarhips are not on par with 'accepted' sports, and that it is not so easy even when some competitive framework (e.g. a league) already exists -- but I would love to be wrong about that.\nAnyway, I apopogize for droning on...\n"", ""Situation, you keep referring to title 9, eSports, chess, skill shooting, non physical sports can typically be unisex.

""Contemporaneous"" would probably be a better cutoff point. \n\nSo my view is that boxing is not a sport\n\nWhy not? Boxing fits all of the criteria. It has a purely objective scoring system. Subjectivity only comes into play for tiebreakers (and you state that judgments by officials in unavoidable, so it\'s allowed). It\'s highly spontaneous and reactive. No mechanical, chemical, or biological components of any kind. And it\'s 100% concurrent. You need to specify why you don\'t think it fits.\n', '\nThis is out, unless you want to ban hockey, baseball, volleyball, football, cycling, tennis, polo, and rugby.\n\nEh? Cycling is out because mechanical and because non-reactive motion (yes, the course itself requires some adjustment, but really cycling can be simulated via Peloton or similar). The rest are perfectly fine, as they use only a ball, or a ball plus a stick (and maybe skates), other than protective equipment.\n\nFurthermore, absent this proviso, NASCAR totally fits your other definitions. . .\n\nWell, it\'s a list of necessary conditions, so failing one is sufficient to fail overall. Still, NASCAR involves zero aerobic activity, and it is also possible to simulate or even to relegate to RC racing.\n\nYou should probably loosen this point as well, otherwise tennis and badminton are also out. ""Contemporaneous"" would probably be a better cutoff point.\n\nIf you prefer \'contemporaneous\' to \'concurrent,\' feel free to use the former. I mean that each participant (not necessarily the entire roster -- the amount of participants eligible according to the rules) is involved in the play in some meaningful sense whenever any other participant is involved. Badminton and tennis (and volleyball, etc.) are fine, even though participants are confined to certain regions of the playing area.\nThe idea here is to avoid turn-based activities, and to require meaningful interaction between opposing players.\n\nBoxing fits all of the criteria. It has a purely objective scoring system. Subjectivity only comes into play for tiebreakers.\n\nSo it has an objective scoring system, except when it doesn\'t, which is a significant (possibly pluralist) amount of the time. That\'s not objective any more than a beauty pageant in which all of the other contestants die or get the measles.\n\n(and you state that judgments by officials in unavoidable, so it\'s allowed)\n\nNot quite. I said that judgments are unavoidable, but that in proper sports the officials make the call and agree on it as a united front, and that their conferences are designed such that each official is attempting not to convince the others, but that each official is trying to make the objectively accurate call. Boxing attempts no such thing, as its judges act as independent subjective agents. Their disagreements are not worked out toward an ostensibly objective resolution, but they are instead celebrated (in the technical sense) and announced.\n', ""You've clearly never cycled competitively before. If you are in the peleton, you better be on your toes or you will have a race ending crash.\n\nThe rest are perfectly fine, as they use only a ball\n\nwhich is not allowed under your definition.

You should probably revise your criteria to be more specific/accurate to what you mean.\n\nthat in proper sports the officials make the call and agree on it as a united front\n\nWrong again. In football, baseball, and basketball, the head ref's word is god. It's literally the subjective call of one person in applying the objective rules of the game.\n\nthat their conferences are designed such that each official is attempting not to convince the others\n\nNope. It is side refs and umpires trying to explain to the Head ref what they saw as best they can. Only the head refs opinion matters.\n\nBoxing attempts no such thing, as its judges act as independent subjective agents. \n\nWhich in my mind makes it better than singular subjective opinion of the other sports. In this case you have three people trying to make a subjective judgment on how well each combatant adhered to the objective rules for determining a score in each round. The only difference between that and the other sports is that they do it all at the end instead of periodically throughout the match. To be honest, it doesn't sound like you know that much about boxing, and you're just trying to dump on it.\n"", ""\nYou've clearly never cycled competitively before.\n\nCorrect, as relatively few have. I get that you are passionate about cycling. I whole-heartedly accept that cyclists are athletes. It also involves strategy. That doesn't make it a sport.\n\n[A ball is] not allowed under your definition.\n\nHow so? A ball is not more complicated than a lever.\n\nNo it's a list of unjustified conditions that YOU think are important, but most people don't.\n\nSee my edit to the OP. There are cases in which it matters whether a thing is classified as a sport or not. It's a CMV. I'm stating my view.\n\nWrong. [NASCAR] involves plenty of aerobic activity. What it doesn't involve is elevated heart rate.\n\nEh? You've got that backward. I guarantee you drivers' heart rates are elevated, but pushing a pedal, holding a wheel, and using paddle shifters is not aerobic in any sense. I suppose I could grant that the motor itself uses oxygen, so is in some sense aerobic, but no.\n\nWrong again. In football, baseball, and basketball, the head ref's word is god. It's literally the subjective call of one person in applying the objective rules of the game.\n\nThis is patently false. While it is true that the head referee or umpire has ultimate veto power and gets to declare the official ruling, the head umpire will not overrule the second base ump's call except during a review, just as the head referee will not overturn a PI call downfield, as the different officials have different responsibilities and only those in a position to observe the play are warranted in arguing the case. In these situations, even the disagreements are quickly sorted, as each official's proper goal is to reach a correct call via consensus using only the informed observations of the officials who witnessed the play.\nBoxing sets that goal aside in favor of an adversarial committee approach, which is anathema to objectivity. Moreover, with the exception of a play at the plate in baseball, we are not talking about scoring events, but fouls and outs. Whether the puck or ball crosses the goal, or the ball falls through the hoop, or apart from a close play at the plate (subject to review for objective analysis!), the scores are purely objective. Not so in boxing.\n\nNope. It is side refs and umpires trying to explain to the Head ref what they saw as best they can. Only the head refs opinion matters.\n\nYes, the official ruling is given by the head official, but no, that head official will not offer any opinion on a play out of view. They are explaining only to inform, not to argue. Only when two officials have different vantage points, and one notices something out of view of the other (e.g. ball possessed but toes not down -- one official may spot the possession, but the other will spot the feet), is a conference determined by an 'argument,' but even here it is not an argument but an explanation of fact, and any worthy official will acquiesce when presented with another's more informative view.\nAnd it bears repeating that replay is a thing in most of these events, where a missed call can be corrected. Boxing works with a very different model.\n\nThe only difference between that and the other sports is that they do it all at the end instead of periodically throughout the match.\n\nThat is not even close to 'the only difference.' Only in pageantry are dissenting views maintained. In sport, the ruling is reached with an express goal of avoiding dissent amongst officials, in an effort to make all and only ghe correct calls. Boxing provides fans with an argument that the losing fighter won according to an official. Football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, volleyball, soccer, ..., do no such thing. As fans we may dispute who should have won, but we cannot say that any official agrees with us.\n\nTo be honest, it doesn't sound like you know that much about boxing, and you're just trying to dump on it.\n\nIgnoring the implicit insult, I know plenty about most athletic competitions, and various non-athletic competitions, and I will say when I am out of my depth. It is true that I dislike pugilistic and pankration events, as they are by definition barbaric, but that does not motivate my view. In fact, as noted elsewhere (maybe in the OP), boxing was initially in my 'probably a sport' bin, but I found that it is not especially distinguishable from athletic competitions that I find to be pageantry, such as figure skating.\nI am hardly opposed to violent sports -- I am an avid NFL fan -- but yes, I find fault with a competition the goal of which is to remove one's opponent's physical ability to compete, never mind the problems repeated concussions will invariably cause later in life. Mohammed Ali (or Cassius Clay if you are old enough) may have been the greatest, but not in his twilight years, and some of that was due to the head trauma he had sustained over the course of his career.\nBut no, I am not dumping on boxing in particular -- it simply hallens to be a candidate sport which inexplicably provides for a victory rooted in pageantry. A victory in sport should not be determined by a judge unless that judge is a truly impartial observer who merely tallies empirical facts. That is most decidedly not the case with boxing, as each scorecard is different.\n"", '\nThere are cases in which it matters whether a thing is classified as a sport or not.\n\nTitle 9 barely qualifies, since it can be applied completely subjectively and even to ""club activities"" in as much as they supported by a school. Furthermore, your definition is definitely NOT the one used by the Dept. of Education in determining a sport. So your CMV should really be about the definition itself, not what applies under your currently-unaccepted definition. \n\nIt\'s a CMV. I\'m stating my view.\n\nExactly. And with the exception of boxing, none of the sports listed qualify under your definition. So it\'s literally impossible to change your view on that front. The only possible way to attack this is to attack the definition of ""sport"" itself, which you have conveniently not provided any justification for. I don\'t think any of your 4 criteria are actually fundamental characteristics of a sport, but you disagree, obviously. This discussion can go no further until YOU pony up with the stuff you should have put in your original post. \n\nThat doesn\'t make it a sport.\n\nBy your completely unsubstantiated definition. \n\nA ball is not more complicated than a lever.\n\nIt absolutely is. We aren\'t talking simply a ""roughly spherical object"" for any sport except soccer. You should be more precise in your definitions. \n\nI guarantee you drivers\' heart rates are elevated\n\nThey aren\'t. Those dudes are ice cold on the track. \n\nI suppose I could grant that the motor itself uses oxygen, so is in some sense aerobic, but no.\n\nLiterally breathing to survive is aerobic activity. I assume that\'s not what you meant in your definition, so you should revise. \n\nWhile it is true that the head referee or umpire has ultimate veto power and gets to declare the official ruling, the head umpire will not overrule the second base ump\'s call except during a review,\n\nOut of professional courtesy and the fact that they have to work with the same people week in, week out. It absolutely CAN happen and has before in rare instances. You are flat wrong. Besides, overturn on review is enough to make the point stand. The head ref is ultimately the only opinion that matters. \n\njust as the head referee will not overturn a PI call downfield,\n\nHas happened before, will definitely happen again. \n\nas each official\'s proper goal is to reach a correct call via consensus \n\nNope. Literally the opposite of how it works. There is no consensus required. The head ref is the only opinion that matters. Granted, he will likely take everyone\'s opinion into account, based on the fact that reffing squads very often work together as a unit, and he has to face those guys after the game, and also has to face league action if he appears blatantly partisan, but it\'s still irrelevant to the cold hard fact that only one opinion matters on the field: his. \n\nAnd it bears repeating that replay is a thing in most of these events, where a missed call can be corrected. Boxing works with a very different model.\n\nSOME missed calls can be corrected. But in baseball and football, a NON-call cannot be corrected in most cases. The same is true in boxing. I\'m not sure what your point is here. \n\nthat head official will not offer any opinion on a play out of view. They are explaining only to inform, not to argue. \n\nYou\'re simply wrong on this point. That\'s out of professional courtesy, not obligation or ""objective rules"". \n\nIn sport, the ruling is reached with an express goal of avoiding dissent amongst officials,\n\nRepeating this falsehood won\'t make it more true. \n\nBoxing provides fans with an argument that the losing fighter won according to an official.\n\nIn cases of a tie, and then by an OBJECTIVE set of scoring rules. Especially in amateur boxing and kickboxing. You\'re just wrong. You have no idea how boxing works, clearly. That\'s not meant to be an insult. It\'s just a fact. \n\nI will say when I am out of my depth.\n\nSo, ummm, boxing? Cause obviously so. \n\nI found that it is not especially distinguishable from athletic competitions that I find to be pageantry, such as figure skating.\n\nOther than the fact that you are completely wrong about ""pageantry"". There is a CLEARLY objective way to win a boxing match. It\'s the MAIN way to win a boxing match. Your hangup is that the TIEBREAKER is SLIGHTLY subjective? So what? You\'ve said yourself that subjectivity is inescapable in sports. And let\'s be honest, the refs have WAAAAAY more ability to shape the outcome of a match in basketball than they do in boxing. They only even get a chance if you FAIL to accomplish your primary goal. That\'s on YOU (the boxer) not the judges. There is zero way to ensure that outcome in gymnastics or ice dancing. Just ask Ecaterina Szabo about that. She won the gold in each of the individual events but somehow only won silver in the combined. That makes zero sense. The judges were not being objective. \n\nA victory in sport should not be determined by a judge unless that judge is a truly impartial observer who merely tallies empirical facts. That is most decidedly not the case with boxing, as each scorecard is different.\n\nAnd each judge received a different set of empirical facts (based on their different viewpoints), so it\'s totally justifiable that their scores would be different. If each judge could watch the entire match from every angle, with replay of every moment in slow motion, it\'s highly likely that they would always score the match the same way. Because there IS an objective standard that they are supposed to use to score. Your complaint is akin to saying ""Some refs call travelling, some refs don\'t; therefore it\'s not objective and is just pageantry"". An argument I have no doubt you would actually DISagree with. \n\nBut no, I am not dumping on boxing in particular\n\nAlright, just also. Whatever. Provide the justification for the 4 criteria that you list or move on. This conversation can go nowhere until you do. \n', 'Trying again, having removed the offending aspects (hopefully).\nFor the record, I did not report your comment. I discovered its removal when I attempted just now to submit the following response:\n\n\nBalls are far more complicated to manufacture than a ""simple lever"".\n\nThen you have moved the goalposts. A ball is not more complicated than a lever.\n\nYeah, I was wrong on that one. But I was wrong in the best possible way. . .\n\nYou were wrong, and no, the physical and mental stress which generates high heart rates does not constitute \'aerobic activity\' in the sense of (virtually) constant and meaningful physical activity. I am talking about physical exercise.\n\nYes, [the plate umpire] can [overrule the call made at second by the second base umpire].\n\nSure. That can happen once per home plate umpire\'s career. I challenge you to provide a single concrete example of this.\n\nHappens ALL. THE. TIME.\n\nThen it should be a simple exercise for you to provide a single credible example in which a head official ignores the observations of the officials on the scene of the play.\n\nThere doesn\'t need to be general agreement. Only the head ref\'s opinion matters. Why can you not get this through your head?\n\nThere is a conference, and the observations of the officials on the scene are used to determine the correct call, via consensus. No head referee would ever deign make an uninformed decision, and the result is a concerted effort at making the objectively correct call. That\'s ""literally the opposite"" of the way boxing judges handle things.\n\n[That an official who did not witness a play might offer an opinion as to what occurred in that play has] happened before and will happen again.\n\nSure. So provide an example.\n\nALL judges and referees are attempting to subjectively apply objective rules.\n\n...except for judges of pageantry, such as boxing, as they don\'t so much as confer with one another, and as you say they do not bother with replay. Note the differences: in one case, officials work together to reach objectively true decisions, and ultimately agree with one voice as to the final score, and in the other case the judges work independently to arrive at different views of the score and final outcome, voicing those different opinions -- just like pageants.\n\nBoxing is not a pageant. It is an objectively based athletic competition.\n\n...which just happens to explicitly provide for subjective judgments when determining victors, just like pageants, or bodybuilding competitions.\n\nThe three judges are placed at three sides of the ring. Their views will be different because of physics and the positioning of the fighters. Some judges will see things that a judge on the opposite side of the ring will not. Judges are not allowed to see replays during the fight. All of this means that THE OBSERVABLE DATA AVAILABLE TO EACH JUDGE WILL NECESSARILY BE DIFFERENT.\n\nRight. So given a split decision, or even a unanimous decision with different score tallies, at least one judge\'s account is necessarily false. But they do not confer with one another, and according to you, they are prohibited from viewing replays in an effort to get it right. So boxing doesn\'t even bother with any pretense of objectivity; it does not care about the objective facts of the bout, and instead celebrates the different subjective opinions of the judges, which you claim counts as objective.\n\nNo, it\'s objective because there exists an objective standard which the judges are supposed to be applying.\n\nSo when Giada and Bobby judge the winner of an elimination challenge on Food Network Star, the fact that ""there exists an objective standard which the judges are supposed to be applying"" (taste, presentation, innovation) makes their judgments completely objective?\nNo. That\'s the definition of subjective judgment. Differences of opinion, it turns out, are hallmarks of subjective judgments.\n\nJudges score a boxing match based on how well each fighter did, based on observable measures of an objective ruleset. It\'s not equivalent, but its highly related.\n\nJudges score a boxing match based on their personal opinion as to how well each fighter did, based on independent and uncorroborated observable measures from disparate and partitioned perspectives of an objective ruleset as subjectively judged. It\'s not equivalent, but it\'s highly related to pageantry.\nFTFY.\n\nI DARE you to defend why your criteria and only your criteria should be the objective standard for the definition of a ""sport"".\n\nI have done so throughout the post. You are encouraged to review the comments, but nonetheless here\'s the short version:\n\nThere is a need to distinguish between \'sport\' and \'non-sport,\' which latter category may yet include competitive athletic events. This need may be academic, or as entertainment, but it may also be relevant with respect to funding and treatment of activities available in various public capacities. To make the distinction, I have placed candidate \'sports\' into bins on a scale from \'highly likely to count as a sport\' to \'highly unlikely to count as a sport,\' and once completed, analyzed the contents of each bin. The result is that some events, such as boxing, are more akin to gladiatorial pageantry than to sport, and as such they are rejected according to this analysis.\n\n\n(To mods: I hope this edited version is acceptable. It is not my intention to break the rules.)\n(To /u/DC_Filmmaker: clearly we are each pushing the envelope with respect to the rules of the sub. We can leave it here if you like, else we can continue provided a return to civility, if only to appease the mods. We don\'t have to like each other, but we can at least abide by the rules. It\'s up to you.)\n', ""Ugh.\nThe manufacturing process of a thing does not change the classification of the thing as fundamentally simple. A ball is simple. A bat is simple. A skate is simple. A car is complex. A bicycle is complex. A firearm is complex. A horse is complex.\nThe bins were not created according to my definition. It's the other way around. If you were reading closely, I think you might've spotted that. Bins first, then see what distinguishes between contents of the outside bins (most likely candidates or rejections), and apply those to the middling cases (less likely candidates or rejections). The list of necessary conditions fell out of the bins. Boxing, incidentally, was initially in a likely category, but it could not be sufficiently distinguished from e.g. diving or figure skating.\nComplex mechanical implements reduce sport to industry or similar. Biological implements make athletes out of the animals more than the handlers, and reduces sport to beast-handling (and might require inclusion of e.g. dressage). Each of these also reduces sport to a form of directing an object or animal rather than perfoming the resultant act oneself. Chemical implements is specifically meant to reject firearms, in case an argument is presented that a firearm can be a 'simple' machine.\nI admit that the phrasing regarding aerobic activity is imprecise. I'll have to work on that, but the idea is to require personal calorie-burning motion which is more significant than avoiding or blocking opponents, which would meaningfully count as physical exercise over a broad range of muscle groups. Sitting in a hot car for three hours completing oval-shaped circuits doesn't count. Eliminating this requirement reduces sport to specialized physical activity or no physical activity at all. Playing competitive Fortnite while being flown around by a member of the Blue Angels does not count as sport, even though it is qualitatively identical to NASCAR, and hence NASCAR is also not sport.\nReactive motion is meant to capture the direct competition in a proper sport. To wit, if I can 'compete' without an opponent even present, then my activity is not a sport. Bowling, swimming, high jump, etc., can all be performed in a vacuum. That's not sport. The effect of simply seeing one's opponent in any of these does grant a competitive feel, and surely improves performance, but bowlers play against the frame, not other bowlers; swimmers race against the clock, not other swimmers; high jumpers compete against a measurement, not other jumpers.\nIn a proper sport, I am competing for points directly against my opponent. My time, score, or distance is part of a zero-sum game, wherein my score removes a scoring opportunity for my opponent, or at the least my actions can prevent my opponent from scoring. In golf, or archery, or darts (x01 games), our scores are completely separate, and simply tallied after each turn or at the end, and I cannot prevent my opponent from scoring.\nTaking turns whole cloth, whether bowling or golf or luge, runs against both of these -- I cannot prevent my opponent from scoring, and my own performance is completely divorced from my opponents' performances. Hell, in golf, luge, etc., one's record is measured according to the course (or track), not the opponents.\nBut what you seem to have missed is that whatever we call the things that don't count as sports according to my view, they are still competitions and they still exist, and that's all well and good. I disqualified golf as a sport, but I play (badly) and occasionally watch golf. It's not necessarily that I dislike the non-sport activities, but that they don't make the cut, and better fall into a different category of competitive athletic events. We can still have the Olympics, and cheer for whichever competitors in whichever events we like -- but some of those events are simply not sports.\n...or do you think that synchronized swimming, figure skating, floor exercise, etc., are sports? My position on these is clear. If you think any of these are not sports, then perhaps you might be willing to identify why they are disqualified, but other events are not. Indeed, are there any competitive athletic events you think should not count as sports? List as many as you can, and let's see how well you fare.\nFinally, as regards boxing, I looked up for another commenter the number of bouts in which the outcome relied on the judges and there was at least one judge with a different score. Of 55 recorded bouts in 2018 according to the WBF, 29 involved a decision by the judges with disparate scores. Nine were split decisions.\nThat effort took several minutes of manual tallying.\nBy contrast, I can tally the sum total of officially disputed scores for each of baseball, basketball, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, pickleball, soccer, tennis, and volleyball instantly and in one fell swoop: 0. Championship boxing has more ears bitten off than championship sports have officially disputed scores.\nETA: Boxing is in another odd class, as a competitive event in which neither audience nor participant is aware of the score, except after the event is over. A proper sport should have an actual or implied scoreboard.\n"", ""\nyou should have used standard judgement in placing things in the bins, because your SUBJECTIVE judgement does not match most peoples on which sports qualify or not.\n\nSo I should have applied a different subjective standard to avoid your charge of having applied an inappropriate subjective standard? Argument from popularity?\nNo. I set up the bins, and tossed things inside. Once filled, I checked the contents of the most confident bins, looking for similarities and differences. Widespread similarity was kept as a necessary condition for that bin. The less confident bins then had their contents compared against the necessary conditions which resulted from the first step, and where the opportunity presented itself additional conditions were generated, so long as they preserved the more confident conditions.\nThat is conceptual analysis.\nYet here you are, arguing that a competition which involves sitting in a car and turning left for three hours counts as a 'sport,' and that a competition in which neither participants, nor commentators, nor spectators, nor the officials themselves can know the current status or the outcome until well after the fact counts as a 'sport.'\nIn a proper sport, at any point I can identify the currently winning team or player. In boxing, after the bout is over and we are both still standing, I must huddle on that little couch and watch the screen awaiting the judges' scores like the ice dancer.\nI get your passion, but you are simply wrong on every point you have attempted to make, and even when you admit one error, you make another. Seeing as you continue to suggest, against the rules of the sub, that I am arguing in bad faith despite several awarded deltas, perhaps you should find another hobby.

Probably I could've stated that part better -- the spontaneous reactive motion is meant to be not mere avoidance, but as I try to phrase it precisely (i.e. positively without adding an exception), I find myself unable to do so. Racers who position themselves as obstacles for other racers (whether to block or to take the better line) are acting intentionally in the furtherance of the event's goal, so crafting that concern without an exception for 'mere avoidance' seems unavailable, and it might not fully avoid your objection; the action by the blocking or line-taking racer just is reactive in a sense.\nI will grant a !delta on that point.

My guess is that you haven't done it competitively but there is a reason that it is described as a chess match at 50 km/h.  I could go on about how grueling the sport is but I really want to impress upon you is actually how sporting it is.  \nIn road racing, they race on teams.  Everything comes down to when you use your energy because if you are drafting in the pack you expend about 30-40% less effort.  So if you intend to win you need to make a big move.  So teams will send riders away in a break away from the pack and other teams have to decide if they will sacrifice their riders strength and energy chasing it down.  Alliances between rivals are made on the road both in the break away groups and the main chase group.  Often this plays out over hours.\nI can't do justice to the whole strategy of bike racing but it gets complex and it is played out in real time by people making hard decisions about whether they will go into the red zone for a chance to win the race.  Their effort could backfire only to help a rival win instead.\nThe score is really quite simple.  Whoever crosses the line first wins.  Sometimes it is from a well executed break away and the main pack miscalculated when to chase and reel it in.  Other times it comes down to a bunch sprint.  Sometimes there are mountains and power to weight ratio comes into play, all of which makes the chess match while riding more complex.\nIt's a hell of an interesting sport.\n"", 'You have made much the same point that /u/iguanaaa1 made after you, but which I read first.

Remember when you said scores are objective point based systems, but that some level of officiation would be inevitable? Boxing doesn\'t really have judges the same way pageants have judges. The boxing ""judges"" are just three guys doing their best to keep track of the score in a sport where the points fly around as rapidly as punches. No other game has the same level of strain placed on scorekeepers, so multiple dedicated experts are necessary. \nIn football, you got dudes crossing into the in-zone but then the entire play gets invalidated because of an offensive penalty. Or you\'ll have a guy drop a pass on the fourth down, which is objectively a turnover, but the officials will judge that it was pass interference and declare a do-over. Basketball is an even better example of how officials apply subjective standards to a game where the points should be objective. Objectivity is the goal, but there is no sport with true perfect objectivity. Boxing is a contest where the challenge of achieving objectivity is especially difficult due to the pace of the scoring. Regardless, the judges are just counting punches and tallying shit up according to objective scoring criteria. \nAs a final point, I\'ll also point out that the objective victory condition of boxing is scoring a KO. The TKO system is just a backup scoring system in case a full KO doesn\'t happen. \n', ""\nBoxing doesn't really have judges the same way pageants have judges. \n\nI completely disagree.

A TKO is also an objective victory in a bout (i.e. 3 knockdowns in a single round). These are the ideal outcomes for a bout, but bouts always end at a preset time (no overtime), and they always end with a declared victor (no ties), and where there is neither a KO nor TKO the system by design relies on the differing opinions of the bout's judges.\nInsofar as the judges are a 'backup' system in case there is not a (T)KO, most bouts end in this way, and this ostensible 'backup' system is the de facto standard. There is no such 'backup' system in place for baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer, tennis, volleyball, etc. In these, one team or player wins, else there is a tie.\n"", 'Oh fun, okay I can keep up with these. \n\n\nBoxing doesn\'t really have judges the same way pageants have judges. \n\nI completely disagree.

The judges in pageants, baking competitions, AGT, American Idol, Miss Universe, etc., are likewise there to determine a winner -- most of which are split decisions -- just in case each participant remains at the end of the competition.\n\nTwo points. First, the singing and beauty and cooking contests don\'t have an objective victory condition. It\'s not ""just in case each participant remains,"" it\'s when they remain. Barring a sudden medical situation, all participants will end up in front of the judges in all cases. Second point, boxing judges aren\'t making their decisions at the end. They\'re just reporting the score they counted. They made their decisions on each individual punch as to whether or not it landed. The reason judgment is inevitably split is because humans are fallible and people will miss a few valid points, or invalidate some punches that the other judge might have had a better angle to see.\n\n\nObjectivity is the goal, but there is no sport with true perfect objectivity.\n\nAgreed, however following a basketball game all officials agree that one team won. None of the officials dissent. \n\nCorrect, but for one key reason. The officials convene at critical junctures to make a final ruling, and that ruling is used. Officials will have dissented then, but their dissent will have been overturned. This is only practical because basketball has a slower pace than boxing. These critical moments won\'t disrupt the game as much, so there\'s no harm in letting the judges have a little pow wow on the court. This also allows the judges to award penalties that determine the flow of the game, so it\'s necessary for basketball. b\nBoxing doesn\'t award advantages, so there\'s no need for the judges to convene. \n\n\nAs fans we might say a different team should have won, but we will not be justified in saying that the losing team did win, with support from any of the officials.\n\n\nThe difference with boxing is that every single punch has the potential to cause dissent amongst the judges. They could stop the fight whenever the judges disagree on a punch so that they could make their ruling together, but there are literally hundreds of punches to consider. It makes more sense to wait til the very end and allow the judges to convene at that point to determine the ruling. In the end there is only one ruling, just like basketball.\nSide point, people very often disagree with the entire outcomes of basketball, but you never hear from the dissenting officials because their opinions were never voiced like in boxing. Whether or not we hear from the dissenting officials doesn\'t technically pertain to the criteria of sports, though. \n\n\nAs a final point, I\'ll also point out that the objective victory condition of boxing is scoring a KO. The TKO system is just a backup scoring system in case a full KO doesn\'t happen.\n\nA KO is an objective victory in a bout. A TKO is also an objective victory in a bout (i.e. 3 knockdowns in a single round).\n\nOkay, I misspoke there. I thought TKO meant a judgment ruling, didn\'t realize it was three knockdowns.\n\nInsofar as the judges are a \'backup\' system in case there is not a (T)KO, most bouts end in this way, and this ostensible \'backup\' system is the de facto standard. There is no such \'backup\' system in place for baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer, tennis, volleyball, etc. In these, one team or player wins, else there is a tie.\n\nAlright, here\'s why I see it differently. Every sport has a point system. Boxing is the only sport with a game-ending victory condition. In football and basketball, you can\'t accomplish any specific goal to instantly win the game, so you must rely on the point system. These points are subject to the rulings of the officials at the exact time that the points are scored. In boxing, the judges are simply reporting their tally of the scores at the end of the match so as not to disrupt the flow of the fight. \nNowhere in your definition of a sport did you say the officials must convene to make a ruling at the exact moment that a contentious play occurs. This affects the viewers experience, but that is an irrelevant stylistic choice. In a sport where there are no advantages to be awarded (5 yard penalty, turnover, free throw, etc.) there is no need to make sure the officials agree every step of the way.\n', '\nIt\'s not ""just in case each participant remains,"" it\'s when they remain.\n\nFirst off, it is worth noting that this is meant as a relatively entertaining CMV rather than a deep CMV, so I trust we are equally amused. I cannot pretend that I am not being pedantic in a thread devoted to a definition of sport clearly at odds with the colloquial use of the term, but by the same token I don\'t think we are bound to say that whatever gets included in e.g. the Olympics is suddenly deserving of the property being a sport.\nSo yes, I am being pedantic, but also yes, judges in pageants is dependent upon the contestants remaining in the competition, and this is a similarity pageants (and gymnastics, and figure skating) share with boxing, and most assuredly it amuses me greatly to classify boxing amongst pageants.\n\nSecond point, boxing judges aren\'t making their decisions at the end.\n\nAgreed, however I daresay this is also true of various other pageant-like competitions, regardless of athleticism. Figure skating, for example, includes concurrent scoring when a scheduled triple axle is missed or reduced to a double. Scorekeepers (judges) in figure skating apply scoring changes throughout the performance, and tally the results at the end, just like boxing judges. The decisions may well follow from the summation of the concurrent scoring, but that doesn\'t make those scores suddenly objective.\n\nThe officials convene at critical junctures to make a final ruling, and that ruling is used. Officials will have dissented then, but their dissent will have been overturned.\n\nAgreed, however the dissenters are not remotely committed to their views (as I understand it). In the NFL, for example, officials will routinely throw a flag or confer with one another over a given play, but they are, ostensibly, merely stating their observations and comparing those against the rules themselves. When one says the pass was complete, but the other says no, the ball was dropped at the last moment according to a view unavailable to the first official, the call is quickly and easily determined as incomplete.\nIt is only in pageant-like competitions such as boxing that judges by design do not confer, and render disparate judgments as a result. That difference seems key.\n\nBoxing is the only sport with a game-ending victory condition.\n\nI don\'t know that to be true. I expect there are many competitions with a game-ending condition, not including time expiring. Tennis, for example, has matches end when one player (or team in the case of doubles) wins two sets, regardless of the number of games played in the sets. A fictional example (which has been made into a \'real\' \'sport\') is quidditch, in which capture of the \'snitch\' automatically ends the match. Various table games have victory conditions as well, including chess, billiards, etc.\n\nNowhere in your definition of a sport did you say the officials must convene to make a ruling at the exact moment that a contentious play occurs.\n\nI think that was implied, but perhaps not. The main point here is that whatever the ruling on the field, by the head umpire, by the referee, et al., in proper sports the ruling is made and is final and none of the officials would preserve their dissent.\nAll of this said, I award a !delta for making several quality points, and for demomstrating that more nuance is required if I am to continue this noble effort.\n', ""You know I actually tried to fit Quidditch into my examples, but technically you don't win by catching the snitch. You end the game and score a shitload of points, but you would still lose if you had fewer points. It's not technically a win condition. Tennis, on the other hand, does fit the criteria now that I think about it. \nI would still argue the boxing is separate from pageantry because it's the only pageant where you may simply cause brain damage to your opponents to instantly circumvent the judges. You don't see nearly as much of that in synchronized swimming or Iron Chef. I think that your criteria for sports are too harsh on sports that are difficult to quantify objectively. The more exciting an event, the more difficult it is to put rules on scoring. All types of fights require some way to determine a winner, and judgment is the only way to mitigate brutality. Otherwise it's all fight to the death or until serious, life altering injury.\n"", ""\nYou know I actually tried to fit Quidditch into my examples, but technically you don't win by catching the snitch.\n\nOh, I meant it was a game-ending condition, and generally a winning condition, but not necessarily for the team to catch the snitch. I was grasping for known examples of games with end conditions that can be met relatively quickly.\n\nYou don't see nearly as much of that in synchronized swimming or Iron Chef.\n\nHa! Granted.\n\nAll types of fights require some way to determine a winner, and judgment is the only way to mitigate brutality.\n\nThis is an excellent point. If anything it makes me all the more determined to reclassify boxing and pugilistic/pankration events as non-sports. Pageantry amuses me as an effective insult, but they are better classified as bloodsports, and really not sports so much as a form of duel. In the case of boxing in particular, the systemic corruption is another real problem, but that's a different topic.\nAt any rate, it seems that I am back to the drawing board. This was an enjoyable waste of time. :)\n"", ""Any sport where you can win by sucking the right dick should be subject to further scrutiny.

post skiing is mentioned as an activity that is not a sport. I would argue that based on your list of criteria that ski cross is a sport. It has an extremely objective scoring system: first across the finish line, spontaneous, reactive aerobic activity: the skiers are moving very fast over difficult and unpredictable terrain, and are often in very close proximity to each other, collisions are not uncommon which requires that they constantly react to what their competitors are doing, outside of protective equipment, skis and ski poles are functionally simple machines similar to levers, direct competition: racers compete in heats where the top two advance until the final where there is one clear winner. \nI would also argue that some of the speed skating events also meet all the criteria in similar ways to ski cross. \nA previous poster pointed out that it seems strange that activities often grouped together, like wrestling and boxing, would have one categorized as a sport by your definition and one not a sport. I would argue that my example of ski cross highlights similar problems. Most other ski competitions require very similar skills and only fail only one of your criteria. \nIn general you seem to have removed all racing events from the definition by design, but I believe that I have demonstrated that at least two racing events do meet all your stated criteria. Other racing events have perhaps less direct interaction between competitors, but it is primarily a difference of degree not of kind, and the magnitude of the difference (is it meaningful or material) is a judgment call that is inherently subjective.\n', ""I intend to change your mind on at least one, which is cycling.  My guess is that you haven't done it competitively but there is a reason that it is described as a chess match at 50 km/h.  I could go on about how grueling the sport is but I really want to impress upon you is actually how sporting it is.  \nIn road racing, they race on teams.  Everything comes down to when you use your energy because if you are drafting in the pack you expend about 30-40% less effort.  So if you intend to win you need to make a big move.  So teams will send riders away in a break away from the pack and other teams have to decide if they will sacrifice their riders strength and energy chasing it down.  Alliances between rivals are made on the road both in the break away groups and the main chase group.  Often this plays out over hours.\nI can't do justice to the whole strategy of bike racing but it gets complex and it is played out in real time by people making hard decisions about whether they will go into the red zone for a chance to win the race.  Their effort could backfire only to help a rival win instead.\nThe score is really quite simple.  Whoever crosses the line first wins.  Sometimes it is from a well executed break away and the main pack miscalculated when to chase and reel it in.  Other times it comes down to a bunch sprint.  Sometimes there are mountains and power to weight ratio comes into play, all of which makes the chess match while riding more complex.\nIt's a hell of an interesting sport.\n"", ""Yes but on the face of it, almost everyone would group boxing and wrestling together. Likely as they would lump together those sports with things like kickboxing, MMA, etc... Now all of these sports may have differing levels of judge involvement, but they all primarily involve two opponents trying to physically subdue each other according to the preset rules of that particular competition. Your view is that you have a new, and better, definition of what is a sport, but if a grouping fails to group things that are largely agreed upon to be alike, then it has failed as a definitional grouping. So it's ok for your definition to exclude NASCAR - because people understand that NASCAR and basketball are fundementally different, but when your definition splits up something like amateur boxing from heavyweight boxing, you've got a major problem.\n""]",60.04,"[[76.72, 61.16, 79.26, 66.74, 40.69, 72.7, 64.24, 69.11, 62.98, 117.16, 74.49, 57.5, 49.62, 53.81, 65.52, 62.38, 66.84, 62.48, 63.39, 57.1, 56.76, 65.22, 65.22, 52.6, 56.76, 75.91, 59.13, 66.94, 91.11, 87.21, 74.49, 70.63, 72.87, 81.8, 69.11, 79.26, 86.71, 70.53, 56.83, 93.34, 89.38, 72.36, 53.55, 73.85, 69.79, 40.31, 62.38, 74.35, 79.7, 74.19, 74.35, 60.45, 70.84, 72.16, 59.84, 71.04, 63.19, 69.11, 65.89, 64.37, 99.06, 63.49, 67.08, 70.84, 58.32, 75.0, 53.51, 66.03, 67.96, 43.09, 70.53, 50.5, 67.45, 64.85, 66.23, 55.58, 95.67, 47.49, 63.19, 88.06, 59.97, 81.33, 57.2, 62.21, 50.23, 74.15, 65.73, 75.54, 62.01, 43.06, 66.98, 74.35, 108.7, 75.21, 87.42, 83.32], [76.72, 61.16, 79.26, 66.74, 40.69, 72.7, 64.24, 69.11, 62.98, 117.16, 74.49, 57.5, 49.62, 53.81, 65.52, 62.38, 66.84, 62.48, 63.39, 57.1, 56.76, 65.22, 65.22, 52.6, 56.76, 75.91, 59.13, 66.94, 91.11, 87.21, 74.49, 70.63, 72.87, 81.8, 69.11, 79.26, 86.71, 70.53, 56.83, 93.34, 89.38, 72.36, 53.55, 73.85, 69.79, 40.31, 62.38, 74.35, 79.7, 74.19, 74.35, 60.45, 70.84, 72.16, 59.84, 71.04, 63.19, 69.11, 65.89, 64.37, 99.06, 63.49, 67.08, 70.84, 58.32, 75.0, 53.51, 66.03, 67.96, 43.09, 70.53, 50.5, 67.45, 64.85, 66.23, 55.58, 95.67, 47.49, 63.19, 88.06, 59.97, 81.33, 57.2, 62.21, 50.23, 74.15, 65.73, 75.54, 62.01, 43.06, 66.98, 74.35, 108.7, 75.21, 87.42, 83.32], [76.72, 61.16, 79.26, 66.74, 40.69, 72.7, 64.24, 69.11, 62.98, 117.16, 74.49, 57.5, 49.62, 53.81, 65.52, 62.38, 66.84, 62.48, 63.39, 57.1, 56.76, 65.22, 65.22, 52.6, 56.76, 75.91, 59.13, 66.94, 91.11, 87.21, 74.49, 70.63, 72.87, 81.8, 69.11, 79.26, 86.71, 70.53, 56.83, 93.34, 89.38, 72.36, 53.55, 73.85, 69.79, 40.31, 62.38, 74.35, 79.7, 74.19, 74.35, 60.45, 70.84, 72.16, 59.84, 71.04, 63.19, 69.11, 65.89, 64.37, 99.06, 63.49, 67.08, 70.84, 58.32, 75.0, 53.51, 66.03, 67.96, 43.09, 70.53, 50.5, 67.45, 64.85, 66.23, 55.58, 95.67, 47.49, 63.19, 88.06, 59.97, 81.33, 57.2, 62.21, 50.23, 74.15, 65.73, 75.54, 62.01, 43.06, 66.98, 74.35, 108.7, 75.21, 87.42, 83.32]]"

Rape is a horrendous crime. However, it is difficult to prove. Thus, the vast majority of rapists get away with it (legally speaking). However, the fact that they can be accused and have their lives damaged provides some avenue for possible justice. If it totally ruins their life, all the better.

Until they do, I believe my point stands.\nAnd let me throw another curve ball at you: Right now, in 2018, there is nothing mandating these businesses remain open on election day, so they could all close this year if they wanted to.

But now that I think about it, it’s varied which ones I get off. With most I’ve gotten off MLK day, but with others not.  But I’ve always gotten PTO to go vote. I think mandating that into law would be fair and give people the chance to vote if they want to. I don’t know if all companies do, I imagine not. \n', 'As I read the article I linked in my 3rd bullet point, I think the most viable solution really would be that all employers nationwide would either have to grant a couple hours of unpaid leave, or allow an employee to spend time voting in the normal course of their employment.

There\'s no reason voting should be on a Tuesday in the modern world. \n', 'Yes, you could literally make that law.  Others have pointed that out in this thread.  It would, I concede, materially increase voter turnout.  But you could literally put your entire savings in magic beans and hope one grows into a magic beanstalk.  They have about an equal chance of happening.\nI agree with point 2, which of course could be solved without making it a federal holiday\n', 'None of your points refute that making it a national holiday would be a bad thing; only that it may not work as well as people think. What is the harm in making it a holiday? I can only see it helping voter turnout with no negatives.\n', 'My point is that the holiday will not accomplish its stated purpose and if it does not, why have the holiday?  I honestly think the closest thing the holiday would do is to remind everyone of the importance of voting, but nobody seems to be making that point.

This has been widely studied in behavioral science too. \nIf you make voting the default option, most people will vote once they are at the poll. Only a tiny fraction of very insightful voters will acknowledge their own ignorance and vote blank. Most will choose an option even if they don't care/don't understand the implications. \nIs this bad? It may help candidates with simplistic arguments, celebrity candidates, etc. Many latin american countries are cited often about this risk (Brazil comes to mind). However, it is also a way of giving cohesion in societies with educational or cultural challenges, where big sectors of population may never even think of politics unless you force them to vote.\nOn the other hand, requiring a minimum effort to vote ensures a minimum motivation behind each vote. Still Many people may vote frivolously, but you make sure candidates don't target specifically people who cant be bothered to think of politics.\nIn western European countries such as ours, I think the best balance is to make voting easy but not mandatory (this solves mostly what the US comments here were arguing).

Most bad things done in politics are executed by the power of few to influence many, it's usually the evil party that has a smaller supporting group and yet they do well so often because they utilize their greater resources invested by those that stand to gain from their evil, and a minority group with higher utilization often beats out the majority with less. This is a vast oversimplification but it applies to any democracy from the minority NAZI party to the minority evil and more-corrupt-than-other-guys US Republican Party, and everything in between.

Because a vote not cast is a vote they don\'t have to try and win, they actively reduce the electorate to the people that enthusiastically agree with them, contributing to the polarization of the political landscape.\nI\'ve long thought that the American voting system should require not just a majority of votes cast, but rather a majority of eligible voters voting in favor, we\'d have a better system.

If you don\'t like either party (or at least the hacks they\'ve nominated), you can actively vote ""no, try again"".   To avoid interminable elections, the process would have to be sped up to a couple weeks (hooray!).  \nThe problem with this system is that it will still encourage politicians to keep ""no"" voters away, so long as not showing up carries no consequence for them.  If, however, every ballot not cast is an automatic no, then staying home legitimately hurts the candidates.  They will NEED people to go to the polls to have a valid election result.  They will NEED to win votes from everyone they can, because they can vote no or stay home.

This is because every vote represents a threshold for trust and alignment between candidate and voter. Every non-vote, then, is an unmet threshold. This makes non-voters an untapped resource that politicians need to mine to gain an advantage where their polarized bases are already pretty much near maximum utilization.\nNow if I were to play devil\'s advocate against my belief, it would be to argue that if we made voting mandatory, this non-voting mass could be formally captured if they put their abstention in the ballot. This gives politicians a metric to measure polarization and voter disenfranchisement. It directly exposes the failure of the political system, instead of just stigmatizing non-voters as ""apathetic"". \n', 'What does the act of not voting communicate? If you go and vote, putting in an anarchist message, then you have communicated your political view: advocation for an anarchist state. However, if you don’t vote at all, you’ve instead communicated consent to whatever form of government is created; including the creation of a government that could become tyrannical. It is definitely a fair argument that mandatory voting is ill-liberal, but it can still be a decent safe guard on keeping a system democratic. It is more more difficult for authoritarian politicians to gain control if there is maximum voter turn out, as they statistically most often win when voter turn out is low, not high. \nBut back to the main point: not voting cannot be said to be a form of democratic participation, because it is not participation at all. It’s just an individual giving tacit consent to whichever government is created, without their input. From the hobbesian point of view, a state must act to defend itself; and a democratic state would defend it’s political systems by making sure that it keeps any populist or authoritarian leaning politicians in check, which could be partially accomplished by mandatory voting. I hope my perspective helps.\n', '\nIf you go and vote, putting in an anarchist message, then you have communicated your political view: advocation for an anarchist state\n\n…and your vote is considered invalid and your ballot not counted. the result is the same.\n', ""That's a good point; I could adjust my statement that you could vote for a third party candidate more align with your views. That more accurately gets across the point that a democratic system, specifically ones of proportional representation, allow individuals to express views not aligned with the leading parties.

In the event of a failed quorum you could trigger a runoff election or two with only the candidates earning at least a certain percentage of the votes and ultimately trigger a redo election with new candidates if the current set continues to fail to inspire a quorum. \nThis would serve several purposes. Encourage voting without making it mandatory, it\'s in the politicians interest to encourage voters and facilitate the process. Additionally the protest vote would have power in that the population does not have to choose the lesser of two (or more) evils and can reject the candidates outright thus encouraging campaigns to cater to wider constituencies.\n', ""What country are you from if I may ask? There are arguments for and against, and if you are from a country with a small population, then more votes will obviously better help to more accurately gauge the general views of your society. With small populations, it's easier for more radical abnormalities to occur in voting results. Whether or not this argument or other arguments are convincing, will be up to subjective interpretation to determine.\nPersonally I agree with you. When you vote, you both acknowledge and grant power to the party/person you vote for.

Due to corruption, in efficiency of governments etc, not everyone is even REGISTERED to vote. Only about half are (just estimates here) Then, because voting is not mandatory, the turn out is half. So a quarter of the population votes. Out of that, less than half vote for a certain party and they get to be the ruling party. So by being voted for by 20 percent of the full population of the country, you get to rule it. I don't think that's a fair representation of the county.

Understanding this, the only concession the power structure has to make for the people to control themselves is to provide an outlet for hope.

Because these are conversations that have entered the mainstream political discourse. So the majority of Americans, enamored by the mythology that surrounds their government, vest an extraordinary amount of faith in the capacity of their leadership to solve their problems. If one set fails to solve the problems they wait patiently a few years and vote in another set. Despite decades of evidence to prove the contrary, they continue to believe that this is the solution to their problems. Democracy in this country is entirely detached from reality and comparable more so to a fanatical religion. \nAnd I say this with the utmost reverence for the true ideals of Democracy.

21,LastDuck,"I am posting this because I have had problems finding adequate justification and arguments for the model of bicameralism, or the practice of having two legislative chambers in a democratic state. In order for an upper house to have any distinction from a lower house, it needs to be formed differently. Usually this means it is made up by appointment (by panels, leader of government, or other) like the Irish Séanad, by election using a more indirect system like the French Senate, or vocation such as the Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords. The fundamental difference as such for most upper houses is that they're less democratic. Why exactly should a less democratic institution have the authority to 'check and balance' the more representative chamber of the country?You may say that through whatever means they're more qualified or experienced, and provide a rational foil. But the means are arbitrary and have vague justification. This explains why the upper chambers in most countries differ from each other so much.I can understand the context they were created in, but what is the justification for them now?I'm a fairly stubborn person, but I'd like to reconsider on this view just based on the fact I haven't known where to look for the arguments for.

The perfect idea of democracy is that the people know whats best for them and what they want and they cannot make any wrong decisions because it is based off of majority vote, but this does not play out in reality. Lets be real, people can be and are really fucking stupid, its not uncommon for people to vote against their best interests because emotions get in the way of logic. In this circumstance the upper court hopefully has the power to look down at these decisions in an unbiased way and say ""you guys are fucking idiots, your plan is shit and goes directly against what is good for you"" thereby hopefully stopping potentially harmful or stupid things coming into law in a country or nation.

And pure democracy exists in many areas outside of government, such as churches, businesses, fraternities, and all kinds of small social organizations.\n\nBut regardless of whether you want to call the US a democracy or a republic, the US was purposefully designed to NOT be a pure democracy.

No one in their right mind would call Congress an efficient or intelligent legislature with the shut-downs, endlessly compromised and ineffective bills, gridlocking etc.\nI just think it's hard to nominate that as an ideal when the demonstrated effects are so dreadful. \n"", ""That's only one part of  the issue, although it is probably the one Americans are most aware of. \nThe full thing is\nNumber One. Electoral systems:\nFirst-past-the-post means that people are effectively forced into voting for only two parties. The only change is potentially either one being replaced, which has only happened in historically exceptional circumstances. With third parties being non-viable in most elections, the remaining parties are therefore obligated to become big-tent and therefore not have the ability to draft specific and cohesive policy which is necessary for effective governance.  \nThen you also have stuff like the electoral college, which means the President is decided not by the overall consent of the people, or even the overall consent of the states, but effectively by states that just so happen to have a more equal proportion of the two main parties.\nThe net effect is that the government's actions are completely unrelated to the changing desires of the public. It's just a distant charade.\nThis I would say is larger than campaign finance, overall. \nNumber Two. Campaign finance, as you said. Would very easily be solved just by looking to Western Europe.\nNumber Three. Gerrymandering and other measures by the establishment to keep themselves in power.\nThe fact that partisan-controlled state legislatures are the ones drawing electoral boundaries is absolutely ridiculous and is laughable in most the developed world.\n\nThe solution is fairly simple: Change the House of Representatives to a system of Single Transferable Vote. Change the Senate to the Alternative Vote. Abolish the electoral college and have the president elected by the Alternative Vote. Have an independent federal commission which draws constituency boundaries along neutral parameters, and have strict campaign finance laws all around. \n"", ""The U.S. is not a democracy, it's a representative Republic. \nAnd there is a strong argument that political gridlock is a design feature, not a flaw.

However if your cooler is relatively full, there's not that much air to rush in and out. Additionally, cooling/heating air takes a lot less energy than cooling/heating water and food.So in the 30 seconds that the lid is opened, the air inside will warm up, but the items won't.

You are arguing that method 1 is the main source of heat loss, and 2 is nothing in comparison (not sure I'd agree with this- but that's for later).\nThere is another property here, the MASS or VOLUME of ice in the cooler, which is where I think I am losing you. Your assertion that a cooler with a higher volume of ice will be less impacted by heat transfer through method 2 is correct, because even though the ice melts at roughly the same rate via method 2, a lower overall percentage of ice will melt than with a smaller cooler. \nSo are you saying that, all other factors equal, method 2 will be less of an issue for a physically larger cooler? If so, I agree. Are you saying method 1 will be less of an issue for a more expensive cooler (than for a cheaper one of the same volume)? I'd also agree. I think you may be conflating these two statements, or I may be misunderstanding here.

However if your cooler is relatively full, there's not that much air to rush in and out.\n\nOK, I think we have the same fundamental intuition here: Opening a cooler is a bigger deal the larger the ratio of air to ice, because the heat can flow into the air very quickly but can't melt the ice at the same rate.\nSo I'll try to argue this: It can matter dramatically or not, but that depends not only on how full the container is but the kind of ice you're using. Actual cubes could pack a cooler perfectly, but not with room for beverages. Simulations have shown random loose packing of spheres tends to leave about 40% of space unoccupied. A lot of the kind of ice people buy from stores for coolers is literally hollow, almost doubling surface area and drastically reducing volume.\nTLDR: The loss in opening a cooler is related to the shape of the ice as well, which can cause a dramatic influx of heat even for a full cooler.\n"", 'A cooler full of ice and beer will start the day mostly full, but should end the day with just ice, and this not be mostly full, this a lot more ice. \nI  not smart enough to know the math. But as someone who frequently uses a cooler for beer transport, the cooler I use can keep ice for 3ish days when you don’t open it. However after a group of people store their beer in it and drink said beer almost all of the ice is gone.

Sex trafficking increased in Germany after prostitution was legalized due to increased demand for service, for example. And prostitutes did not take advantage of social and medical services at the rate expected when implementing the new law. Since then, Germany has passed more restrictions in order to deal with all the new problems that came up with legalized prostitution, but many believe that this experiment has basically failed both the workers and those who purchase sex.\nSo it's a hard problem. I think people should be able to do sex work if they so choose, but the side effects of legalizing sex work must be dealt with promptly as part of the legislative process. And there's not much in the way of political capital to be gained in advocating for legalized sex work, so these sorts of issues tend to be lower in priority than stuff that excites more of the electorate, like health care and taxes.\n"", ""\nSex trafficking increased in Germany after prostitution was legalized due to increased demand for service, for example.\n\nIs there any data on reasoning for the correlation?

Pornography does not involve the same risks to the actors as prostitution. And certainly massaging is not as physically or emotionally intimate.

26,TheFlamingLemon,"I'll lay out what seems to me to be the absolute minimum for abiogenesis to occur. You must happen to have some valid building blocks for life. This could potentially be all kinds of things; on earth it ended up being various organic materials such as amino acids. We've already created this in lab and know it to be possible to have occurred randomly. While far from impossible, this still lowers the odds of abiogenesis by a significant margin (but not nearly as significantly as what follows)You must, simultaneously, create an organism that will recreate itself. I'll expand on what's necessary for this. It mustA: Have a way of being essentially ""programmed.""

For this, the ""program"" must ""know"":Exactly what comprises it, pretty much down to the molecule. This alone would be an incredibly complex code, as even cells this rudimentary are incredibly complex entities that we have yet to fully understandExactly how to create another copy of itself, down to the molecule, such that the new copy will also have the exact same ""program""Exactly how to create a new copy of itself, using its physical resources and materials in its environment.Consider how incredibly complex this would be. Now consider that no matter how close you get to this end, even if you have a cell that can do every single part of this except for one tiny insignificant bit, you will make no progress; you only make progress if every single necessary condition for this possible is met perfectly.To try and give a better scope of how unlikely this is, I'll explain what this would require if it was for a computer and not cells (even though its redundant since I was effectively doing this the whole time). You would need, basically out of the earth, rocks and elements to organize to make a logic gates and transistors and circuits in such a way that it creates a functioning computer system. This alone is obviously unlikely to the degree of being impossible, but it's the most likely part of this. The computer would have to not only form, but form in such a way that already written into it is a program (thousands and thousands of lines of code, considering how complex computers are) that details exactly how the computer is made up and how to make a new one. The computer would then also need to have the capacity to make more of itself using only the environmental resources it has (meaning it might get cute robotic tools allowing it to assemble more computers. These cute robotic hands would need to have formed randomly with the rest of the computer, including the very code that allows the robotic hands to know what to do). Even the lone step of randomly having code independently develop from something like a robotic hand (metaphor by the way) which happens to also be exactly the right code to control the hand and tell it how to perform a complex task is just laughably unlikely, and equally unlikely is the same thing essentially happening out of organic material.Tl;dr: Reproducing cells are very complex and there's no frickin way they would just occur naturally because of favorable environmental conditions.

Given that the universe started without life, at one point life had to start from the non-living materials that existed. There are no other possibilities.\n', ""I am a bit confused by your view. Are you suggesting that it is more likely that a god of some sort, or a mystical process which is distinct from the universe itself (i.e. physics, time, chance, and opportunity), is demanded for life to emerge?\nWhichever of these or some other view you hold, the fact remains that in our universe we have time, we have elements, we have physics and chemistry, and we have life. We seem to have all that is required to overcome the unlikely event which is the natural formation of life.\nTo wit, imagine a billion-sided die, rolled until it comes up 1. It will take many rolls, assuming each subsequent roll is independent from each previous roll. Yet with a billion opportunities, the probability that the die will come up 1 increase, even though the probability of any given roll does not change.\nSo, assuming we require a 1 to come up on our billion-sided die, the probability that we will see a 1 after n rolls is modeled as follows:\n1 - 0.999999999^n = P\nSupposing we only roll this die once each year for 10 billion years (n = 10^10), the result is P = 0.9999546001.\nSupposing we only roll this die once each decade for 10 billion years (n = 10^9), the result is P = 0.632....\nTo maintain the probability at less than 0.5, we'd have to restrict our number of rolls to no more than 693,147,199, or one roll every two decades over the age of the universe (13.8 billion years). But presumably we only have the earth to work with for our purposes, and that restricts us to only about 4.5 billion years, and our ~700 billion tries would require one roll every 6.5 years. Yet still, life has only appeared on earth for about 4 billion years, so we are down to one roll every 70 months (5.8 years).\nSo your view to this point seems untenable. You would have to insist that there is some barrier to physical chemistry which prevents organic compounds from forming given a 1:1,000,000,000 chance provided one opportunity to hit that chance every 6 years.\nNow, granted, I have pulled the billion-sided die from my ass, but presumably the actual probability of an organic compound forming naturally given chemistry and physics and 9 billion years (prior to our own sun) of stars fusing heavier elements and going nova is not especially much higher. I am happy to accept a probability four orders of magnitude worse, or 1 in 10 trillion, provided that you accept that there are far more than one chance in 6 years for these compounds to form. How many might I need? 6.937×1012 tries. In a timeframe of 4.5 billion years, that would mean I need 1,542 attempts per year, or one try every six hours.\nOne try every six hours, to fit the actual timeline and assuming we are rolling a 10 trillion-sided die, to get things to 50/50.\nSo at minimum, your view seems to rely on a misunderstanding of the scales and timeframes involved. There are surely on the order of a billion or more possible chemical interactions every second, much less one every six hours. The vast majority of these would be unhelpful to generating organic compounds, including complex things like proteins, enzymes, and amino acids, but nonetheless the number of opportunities will far exceed the required minimum unless we unreasonably restrict our values (and without explanation).\nNo. To reduce the probability to something that is truly unlikely would demand an artificial barrier the explanation for which would be itself more unlikely.\nAdd to this the fact that we have the evidence of our own existence, yet no evidence of any gods (Cf. 'weak anthropic principle'), and we have good reason to expect that our universe formed in such a way that we would exist, and did so absent any external, never mind mysteriously divine, influence.\n"", '\nCMV: Abiogenesis is unlikely enough to be considered implausible\nTl;dr: Reproducing cells are very complex and there\'s no frickin way they would just occur naturally because of favorable environmental conditions.\n\nAlthough it\'s not immediately apparent, these two views are almost the exact opposite claims. ""Implausible"" and ""no frickin way"" are different things that require different arguments. Your post argues the former over the latter, so that\'s how I\'ll frame my argument.\nComplex isn\'t an argument against something happening eventually. Emphasis on eventually. The perspective of the entire history and size of the universe sorta implies that any possibility will eventually become reality, given certain assumptions about the universe. If the universe is infinite, then eventually, even that computer you mention in your post will eventually fabricate itself.\n', ""You don't need any complicated programming. You're looking at biology through IT glasses. While that might be an apt anology for the current complex life you see now it didn't start like that. \nInstead early 'life' would've been pure chemistry down in the atomic level. As mentioned simple strands of RNA can form and self-replicate purely through standard chemical bonding.\n"", '\nand know it to be possible to have occurred randomly. While far from impossible\n\nYes during volcanic activity for example.\n\nYou must, simultaneously, create an organism that will recreate itself. I\'ll expand on what\'s necessary for this. It must\n\nOkay, so let me try to de-mistify this a little bit. So we know of an self-replicating abiotic molecules. You can think of it as part\'s of the molecule being rotated in such a way, that other molecules bind on it, until a critical mass is reached, at which point the molecule splits. \nThis is somewhat similar to DNA.\nSo biological cells aren\'t nothing else than bunches of  molecules consisting of amino acids and other biological material. Otherwise it behaves exactly like artificial molecules. However biological material has a an advantage, that it can form soft membranes, it can ""stick"" together much more easilly, it\'s incredibly prone to changes of states, etc... This created an ideal ""mold"" for life.\nSo fatty molecules (created from undewater volcanic activity, alkaline gradients reacting to random compounds, etc...) started to coat the iron-sulphur froth that existed in oceans everywhere (oceans at that time were so acidic, they could melt iron), that created cell-like bubbles. Some of these bubbles would then enclosed self replicating sets of molecules (molecules that consist\'s of compounds rotated and binded in such a way, they gather other molecules they touch into patterns, then reaches critical mass and splits). When the molecules inside this little micro-universe of the bubble reached critical mass they would be pushed outside the bubble, which splits the bubble. \nHeureka, we have first self-replicating cell.\nNow you might ask, but where did the self-replicating molecules got the stuff to replicate inside the bubbles. \nWell, now comes the property of biological matter. The ability to transform heat (and gradient between alkaline fluid and the acidic ocean) into energy. Which is basically more usable heat. The heat then breaks down the barriers between ""stuff inside the bubble and outside"" to get more ""stuff that binds better to molecules"". Eventually these proto-cells bumped into each other, and other compounds, resulting in random permutations and configurations of these proto-cells. \nThis eventually lead to proto-organisms creating constantly more difficult cells. For example. Imagine cells doing a certain chemical reaction when it bumps into a source of heat. Which then creates ""energy"" inside the cell. Which then allows the cell to split. \nWell a cell that happened to do this chemical reaction in such a way, that small amount of heat is released on the opposite side of the cell from where the source of heat came from. That would create a heat differential between the warmer and colder part of the ocean. Which then would move the cell.\nWell now you have fucking motion. And inteligent one (if cell detects heat, it moves even closer) at that. \nThis is pure chemistry.\nAnd after couple of billion of years of this random bumping. Molecules that were ""better"" as in more suitable to survive in those environments lived. And developed increasingly more complicated traits more suited on gathering energy. Those who didn\'t, died.\nThis is evolution\n', '""Self-replication"" isn\'t necessarily as complicated as you make it out to be.  You have this idea that there are smart machines involved, but self-replication can be incredibly simple in a friendly environment:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis\n', '\nthis still lowers the odds of abiogenesis by a significant margin\n\nThat doesn\'t make sense at all. It raises the odds, knowing things can appear without intervention.\n\nYou must, simultaneously, create an organism that will recreate itself\n\nThere\'s no need for all of this to poof into existence.

Granted these are minor variations given our technology, but we do have to take them into account for precise measurements like GPS. To put it simply, we each experience time slightly (and unnoticeably from our perpsective) differently due to a myriad of factors. If time didn\'t exist, that wouldn\'t be possible.\nLooking at something timeless like God, well, it becomes weird. A photon travels at the speed of light, and from its perspective does not experience time (or even space). From our perspective, it is emitted, flies around, and is eventually absorbed. From its ""viewpoint"", it arrives exactly when it is emitted and so never had a chance to even a have a viewpoint.\nGod would be the same way. To not experience time is the same as not existing. Even if he exists ""forever"" (which is a meaningless idea without the concept of time), not being able to change means not being able to have thoughts, feelings, or even observations. All those things require a change of some sort. You can\'t start to feel happy because starting implies a change. \nSo a god without time is no different than no god.\n', 'The idea of time was made to track change.

28,DrugsOnly,"Now, I'm taking a graduate level addictions therapies class. I also have a friend that recently had a baby. Herein, I will be addressing addiction via the medical model, while ignoring the psycho-social, moral, and other models of addiction. I'm aware that my view doesn't hold up via those current models. However, it technically holds true over the medical model of addiction. If you wish to be more well versed on the medical model, here's a link that describes it pretty well: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1511480 Furthermore, I'm using milk and baby formula interchangeably here. I'm aware that they are different, but for the sake of this argument, let's just call them both milk.​However, to assert my point, I will explain the medical model of addiction, albeit less in-depth, to adhere to why babies are technically milk addicts. Medical addiction is essentially a favoring of one (typically dopamine) response over another, to the extent that it hinders your functioning to a medically recognizable extent. Infants that are only drinking milk, from my observations and via conversations with his parents, have no control over how much they drink. Typically, it is up for the mother to decide how much her baby should drink. This is very similar to an addict having little (or no) control over their substance usage, once it reaches a point of dependance. Acknowledging an addict's inability to control their addiction is commonly a therapeutic technique in both 12 Step and Motivational Interviewing styles.​Infants also show physical symptoms of withdrawals when they do not get their milk ""fix."" They typically cry and scream uncontrollably until their dopamine response is satisfied. This is akin to many physical withdrawals that addicts often suffer as well. In my opinion, the best Hollywood depiction of physical dependance is shown in Leonardo Dicaprio's character in Basketball Diaries here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsIs23gnpOQ (Warning this isn't something fun to watch, but it is great acting.) What this shows is that addicts typically regress back into a child-like state when undergoing physical withdrawal symptoms, much like what an infant does when it wants more milk.​I believe that acknowledging that we all generally start off as addicts can help us all have a better view on addiction. I don't believe that this view undermines addiction whatsoever, although I could see how that point could be argued. Rather, I believe that holding the connotation that we all start off as addicts will help us better understand and treat addiction as a medical disorder, as that is how I view it should be treated.","['DeltaBot', 'scottevil110', 'DrugsOnly', 'scottevil110', 'DrugsOnly', 'scottevil110', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'Rainbwned', 'DrugsOnly', 'Rainbwned', 'DrugsOnly', 'Rainbwned', 'DrugsOnly', 'Rainbwned', 'DrugsOnly', 'Rainbwned', 'DrugsOnly', 'Mddcat04', 'miguelguajiro', 'DrugsOnly', 'miguelguajiro', 'exotics', 'DrugsOnly', 'exotics', 'DrugsOnly', 'miguelguajiro', 'DrugsOnly', 'miguelguajiro', 'DrugsOnly', 'miguelguajiro', 'DrugsOnly', 'exotics', 'DrugsOnly', 'mechantmechant', 'alaricus', 'Shiboleth17', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'ddujp', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'Glory2Hypnotoad', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'DrugsOnly', 'I_am_the_night', 'DrugsOnly', 'Brown_Sugar_Time', '7nkedocye', 'DrugsOnly', 'Clockworkfrog', 'DrugsOnly', 'MrSnrub28', 'DrugsOnly', 'MrSnrub28', 'DrugsOnly', 'MrSnrub28', 'DrugsOnly', 'mfDandP', 'mule_roany_mare', 'rowdyrider25', 'DrugsOnly']","[""/u/DrugsOnly (OP) has awarded 1 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", 'I think the clear difference between a baby:milk and a junkie:heroin is that milk is the baby\'s sole source of nutrition, and it will literally die without it.

By this logic, I\'m \'addicted\' to food and water.  As to your comment about babies not ""knowing how much milk they need to survive,"" and drinking more than necessary, that\'s basic evolutionary biology.  A baby doesn\'t understand scheduling, it doesn\'t know that it will be fed on a consistent basis.  Animals (and people) provided with unlimited food have the same issue; they consume to excess because they\'re evolutionary programmed  to.  In nature, you never know for certain when your next meal will occur, so your body tells you to consume as much available food as possible in order to keep you from starving for the longest possible time.  Humans are (generally) able to moderate these instincts because they have higher cognitive functions.  A baby doesn\'t have that, all it has are its instincts that tell it that it needs to eat to stay alive.  Domestic animals have this same issue; if given unlimited food, they\'ll just continue to consume until they have negative health outcomes (obesity, heart disease).  None of this is \'addiction,\' its a conflict between evolutionary instinct and modern society. \n', 'Medical addiction is essentially a favoring of one (typically dopamine) response over another, to the extent that it hinders your functioning to a medically recognizable extent.\nGiven that role expectations for a newborn generally are limited to: eating (drinking milk or formula), sleeping, eliminating, and parental bonding; I don\'t think that their favoring of milk is hindering their functioning in a meaningful way.

Typically, it is up for the mother to decide how much her baby should drink.\nNo, they get full. With a lot of babies, the parents actually have to work really hard to get them to eat enough.\nI think you have an interesting premise, and the idea that addiction is a regressed behavior going back to infancy makes a lot of sense on it\'s face - but that isn\'t enough to establish that babies are mild addicts.\n', ""Well it does hinder their functioning if you consider the physical withdrawals they suffer from wanting more milk than necessary.

They are being tricked into thinking they are eating more via sucking on a plastic, fake nipple. \n"", 'If a baby is experiencing a ""physical withdrawal"" from milk, it means they are undernourished and need to feed. This isn\'t the same as experiencing a physical withdrawal from alcohol, or heroin.\nAs to the latter point - simply google ""my baby won\'t breastfeed"" and watch the results come streaming in. Babies who feed without problem will stop eating once they are full. And babies who use pacifiers will no longer be satisfied with sucking the pacifier when they actually experience a physical need to eat - they will spit it out and cry for actual nourishment. Pacifiers calm babies because sucking is one way they\'ve learned to be connected to others, and the same reason why they will be soothed by swaddling (because it mimics being held), rocked, etc...

I'm merely extending it to their nutrition standpoint as well.\n\nDo you think that babes are defecation addicts too, given that they cry when their diaper is full and that the act of defecation can actually trigger a dopamine response/sense of relief?\n"", ""I'm not arguing about babies being defecation addicts. I'm not well versed enough to know which neurotransmitters are released when pooping occurs to have a stance on it either way. I'm also not trying to find that out either.\n\u200b\nLike many food addicts, infants engage in crying and/or screaming out typically more necessary for their survival. I believe this is noted fundamentally via how pacifiers are able to work.\n"", ""\nI'm not arguing about babies being defecation addicts. \n\nYou kind of are, though.  Youre essentially saying that any human action that is performed regularly that produces a dopamine response makes the actor an addict regardless of any needs that action fulfills.\n\nLike many food addicts, infants engage in crying and/or screaming out typically more necessary for their survival.\n\nSo now you're saying they're crying/screaming addicts too?\nThey're babies.  They aren't dependent on food because of the dopamine response, they get a dopamine response because they are dependent on food to live.\n\nI believe this is noted fundamentally via how pacifiers are able to work.\n\nPacifiers take advantage of preexisting sucking reflexes to calm a baby.  My understanding is it has little to do with dopamine.\n"", 'I may have wrongly proposed the medical model of addiction while simplifying it. The dopamine response needs to be favored over others to an extent that it hinders your life for it to be considered an addition. This may be technically evident in infants crying out for food when they don\'t actually need it.\nArguing wherein the dopamine response comes from is like arguing ""the chicken and the egg."" I\'m saying they both exist. It could be innate, however, that doesn\'t stop it from inadvertently and technically being an addiction.\nRegarding pacifiers working, I view it on the neurological level. Sucking is the action babies have to take to get their dopamine reward. This is probably neurologically connected, in some capacity, with the dopamine reward system. It may be an innate trait, and probably is, but that doesn\'t change what it does.\n', '\nThe dopamine response needs to be favored over others to an extent that it hinders your life for it to be considered an addition. \n\nAgreed, so what is your evidence that this is the case in babies wanting milk?\n\nThis may be technically evident in infants crying out for food when they don\'t actually need it.\n\nAgain, what is your evidence that babies cry for more milk than they need?  Babies often cry, and figure out why is sometimes a trial and error process.  They will refuse a feeding if they are not hungry and are crying for a different reason.\n\nArguing wherein the dopamine response comes from is like arguing ""the chicken and the egg."" I\'m saying they both exist.\n\nNo, by claiming it\'s an addiction you are necessarily claiming that the dopamine response is the reason for the behavior, not the biological need.  You are making that claim and have yet to back it up with evidence.\n\nIt could be innate, however, that doesn\'t stop it from inadvertently and technically being an addiction.\n\nIt\'s not an addiction to be hungry.\n\nRegarding pacifiers working, I view it on the neurological level. Sucking is the action babies have to take to get their dopamine reward.\n\nThe sucking reflex is present even in situations where the baby is not rewarded in any way.  They suckle unconsciously.\n\nThis is probably neurologically connected, in some capacity, with the dopamine reward system.\n\nMaybe, but so is pooping.  Are you a poop addict because you keep doing it regularly and getting a dopamine reward for it?\n\nIt may be an innate trait, and probably is, but that doesn\'t change what it does.\n\nIt\'s function is to aid the baby in feeding.  That\'s what it does.  You\'re the one claiming it\'s an addiction.\n', '\nAgreed, so what is your evidence that this is the case in babies wanting milk? \n\nWell that\'s a part up for debate. Nobody can really argue why babies are crying, or if they can control how much milk they drink, without scientific literature to back up their claims. However, I\'m stating that one of the reasons they do cry may perhaps be due to medically addictive tendencies. \n\nNo, by claiming it\'s an addiction you are necessarily claiming that the dopamine response is the reason for the behavior, not the biological need. You are making that claim and have yet to back it up with evidence.\n\nAddictions can be both learned behavior and innate ones as well. This is evident with many food and sex addictions, to some extent even trichotillomania perhaps, if you call that an addiction. I\'m not sure if it technically is or not. \n\nMaybe, but so is pooping. Are you a poop addict because you keep doing it regularly and getting a dopamine reward for it?\n\nI\'m not stating that pooping is an addiction, again, since I\'m not trying argue the dopamine reward system therein. Does pooping feel good? Sure. Does that mean we control how much we eat so that we can poop more and wind up being addicted to it? In most instances probably not. I think I do recall that being an mental illness in ""Girl Interrupted,"" but said disorder isn\'t very wide spread, from what I have noticed.\n\nIt\'s function is to aid the baby in feeding. That\'s what it does. You\'re the one claiming it\'s an addiction.\n\nYes, and with it being a biological function comes innate reward systems therein as well. I\'m asserting that infants are typically not in a position of cognitive development, wherein they can adequately control those biological functions. If you want to bring poop in this argument, let\'s do that. It is clearly evident that babies cannot really control where they poop yet, so they almost always soil themselves. What extent of cognitive development needs to occur for an infant to know that it is sufficiently satisfied with nutrients?\n', '\nWell that\'s a part up for debate. Nobody can really argue why babies are crying, or if they can control how much milk they drink, without scientific literature to back up their claims.\n\nThen why does your OP affirmatively state that you believe babies are milk addicts?  Why have you repeatedly argued throughout this thread that babies are crying to get fed because they get a dopamine reward for drinking milk?\n\nHowever, I\'m stating that one of the reasons they do cry may perhaps be due to medically addictive tendencies. \n\nYour view is that babies are addicts and that ""we all start off as addicts"".  That is according to your OP.  If that has changed, or you are backing off from that, you should award the person who changed that view a delta.\n\nAddictions can be both learned behavior and innate ones as well.\n\nOne can become addicted to the reward for innate behaviors, but that\'s not the same as saying that addiction is innate.  Food addiction isn\'t merely that somebody eats, it\'s that they eat too much for the wrong reasons.  \n\neven trichotillomania perhaps, if you call that an addiction. I\'m not sure if it technically is or not. \n\nIt\'s more of a compulsion than an addiction.  There are similarities between the two, as compulsion is indeed part of addictive behavior, but trichotillomania is really more of a single behavior done as part of a routine rather than for some kind of dopamine reward.  Obviously that\'s oversimplifying it, though.\n\nDoes pooping feel good? Sure. Does that mean we control how much we eat so that we can poop more and wind up being addicted to it? In most instances probably not. \n\nDoes drinking milk feel good to babies?  Sure.  Does that mean they control how much they cry so they can eat more and wind up being addicted to it?  In most instances probably not.\n\nI\'m asserting that infants are typically not in a position of cognitive development, wherein they can adequately control those biological functions. \n\nWhy is advanced development needed to prevent addiction?  It seems to me that more complex behavior patterns are what leaves room for addictive behaviors to form.  A baby is just satisfying its need to drink milk, or at least drinking milk in a way functionally indistinguishable from genuine need.  You really need a lot more evidence to support the claims you\'re making.\n', '\nYour view is that babies are addicts and that ""we all start off as addicts"". That is according to your OP. If that has changed, or you are backing off from that, you should award the person who changed that view a delta.\n\nI misspoke in my original argument and have made a logical fallacy called an ultimatum statement. However, within my initial post I have already conceded that this point is probably a majority and nobody has been able to empirically state the otherwise. My lack of clarification does not warrant a delta in my view. I had another change my view wherein I was led to the assumption that typically anything that isn\'t a predetermined response from the OP could be awarded with a delta. That argument was presented to me very much like how you\'re stating that backing off from an argument is worthy of a delta. That\'s essentially like stating that any further clarifying points should be awarded with a delta. If that\'s all you\'re looking for, I can give you a delta, but my view hasn\'t really changed. Moreso, it has been further refined.\n\nOne can become addicted to the reward for innate behaviors, but that\'s not the same as saying that addiction is innate. Food addiction isn\'t merely that somebody eats, it\'s that they eat too much for the wrong reasons.\n\nYes, however, the biological reward processing therein was already predetermined for food at least. Opiates, from my understanding, also use predetermined neural-pathways. However, the Route of Administration (ROA) and subsequent rewards therein create a new experience, wherein the addiction becomes a learned behavior.\nI could really give you a delta for the trichotillomania clarification as well. However, I do enjoy discussing this with you, and if I give you what you\'re after, I\'m worried that will end our discussion. \n\nWhy is advanced development needed to prevent addiction? It seems to me that more complex behavior patterns are what leaves room for addictive behaviors to form. A baby is just satisfying its need to drink milk, or at least drinking milk in a way functionally indistinguishable from genuine need. You really need a lot more evidence to support the claims you\'re making.\n\nAdvanced development needs to occur to prevent milk addiction, as I\'m arguing that they simply have no control over their actions, regarding drinking milk specifically. Thereby, they are also technically addicts, given the medical model as well. Essentially, we both need a lot more evidence to support either of our claims. That might have been a fault of mine, presenting something so nuanced under the guise of simplicity.\n', 'It’s not up to the mother how much the baby should drink.  The milk ducts can only make so much, it’s not an ever flowing beer keg.  Many women have issues making enough milk for their newborns.  Whether a newborn food source does s breast milk or formula or a combo is no more of an addiction than me craving food when I wake up to I can be functional at work tomorrow.\n', ""Why do you focus on babies instead of applying the entire comparison to animals/humans and food? or animals and breathing?\nI show signs of withdrawal when I don't breathe. I become irrate, I will scream, and I can't stop breathing, but that doesn't make me addicted, as breathing is a essential biological function. Eating is the same.\n"", ""Well, because my friend recently had a baby and that is what I noticed. She was constantly pumping milk or feeding her baby while we were together. If not, the baby would often require a pacifier, else he would scream out for more milk. Typically, animals (and humans) do not need to control how much they breathe. It is an innate biological function that tends to work well enough on it's own that we do not even need to think about it. Of note however, my friend's baby doesn't even know how to drink properly. He always has to burp after drinking, since he swallows too much air while drinking. Apparently, this is very common among babies, at least that's what my friend told me.\n"", 'Why are you even trying to apply medical definitions of anything to the opinions of one mom?\n', ""Well it's a two-fold factor. I'm generally bored and thinking to much, due to my medically diagnosed manic state that I'm currently in.\n"", 'I am pretty sure you are misunderstanding the ""medical model of addiction"" if it includes things like food that people require to survive.\n', 'No, some adults people are addicted to food as well.\n', 'Some? Not all?\n', ""Yes, some. Addiction has to hinder some other life functioning for it to be called addiction. Medically, the dopamine (typically) reward system has to be favored over others to an extent that it negatively impacts one's life.\n"", 'I don’t know about you but i feel that starving to death would negatively impact my life.\n', ""Yes, but starving isn't typically regarded as a withdrawal symptom. It can be, but I'm not sure that it is actually considered one, in most instances. In terms of most food addictions, individuals are eating too much. Not eating enough is another eating disorder, that isn't considered an addiction, to my knowledge.\n"", ""the reason infants like milk is because they can't sit up straight to eat pureed foods without aspirating it.\n"", 'Drugs have more potential to harm than a lot of other things in this world.\nBecause of that drugs should be regulated. Making them illegal feels good, but the truth is you cannot effectively abolish them. Giving up all control has made them more available not less.\nHigh school kids have an easier time getting weed and heroin than they do alcohol.\nDrugs being criminal also cuts off access to support and treatment.\nDrugs=illegal is the worst of all worlds. Anyone can get them, without the ability to enforce a contract the players instead use violence. The life and death nature of the business makes it a very efficient market & absence of regulatory capture drives prices down.\nIronically the black market is the purest capitalism around, & it really is effective at keeping products available and cheap.\n', 'They are actually poop making machines.\n', ""Well yes, however, that doesn't really change my view.
