      "Fascism is an authoritarian structure of government with several hallmarks:How does this reconcile with the current state of the US government and its leader? It doesn’t.Let’s refute the points one by one:There has been absolutely no forcible suppression of political opponents. Perhaps there are some tweets that you don’t like or that are unbecoming of the office, but that is not akin to enacting policies for forcible suppression. Trump has removed regulations on the private sector, something that is incompatible with fascism.Where are the policies that place restrictions on free speech, religion, or ideology? Tweeting that the media is “fake news” is not any of those things. If anything, the far left occupies the space where free speech and ideology is being challenged and limited today. Trump always talks about putting America first regarding manufacturing, policies, and federal funds. This is not the same as the ultranationalist tendencies that are found in fascism. In his belief, this is what the leader of a nation should do - always put the needs of its own citizens above others. The definition of nationalism is rather neutral, it would depend almost entirely on the execution of each situation.Change my view.\n"

Corporations of the size that can sway a government benefit from a relaxation of government oversight because they can then get away with more than they could otherwise.  Especially when it comes to anti-competitive practices which put businesses of the smaller and non-corporate type at a major disadvantage.  \n",

      "I mean, your 2nd hallmark couldn't be more wrong.  Fascism is about protecting corporate power to the point of making aristocrats of corporate leaders.  Labor is to be subjugated.  Trump has been incredibly effective at doing these things.  Corporations overall are doing better than ever.  The Supreme Court has a conservative (read corporation friendly) majority likely to last a generation.  The list goes on: Trump is an avowed nationalist with his \"America first\" proclamations, his disdain for human rights is unequivocated, he calls for the control of mass media, nobody denies his cronyism and nepotism, even his incredible sexism is a tenet of Fascist policy.  \n",
