      "['Admira1Jackbar', 'There are two components to my argument. First, I believe that releasing the results, in the manner that she did, will strategically/politically hurt her chances in 2020.Second, I believe the way in which she has sold her Native American ancestry is morally wrong.How should Warren have proceeded? I believe that she could have publicized her results without coming off as offensive and culturally incompetent. She could have used the video to honestly explain that her family had hyperbolized her Native American roots, that she does not identify as Native American, and that she has not been oppressed in any way because of her ancestry. This has been a rambling post, but I think ya\\'ll get my major points.\\u200bEdit#1: Thank you so much all for engaging in this conversation. I have tried to respond to as many posts as I can but unfortunately have to get back to studying. My perspective is largely unchanged but I will continue trying to respond when I can. Furthermore, there has been some misinformation about the DNA test results and how they are interpreted. One user linked me this article, which has a great breakdown of what the test means. In summary, it is much more likely that Warren is 1/64th native American as opposed to 1/500th or 1/1,000 Native American. This doesn\\'t really change my main points, but it is good to get the facts straight.\\u200bEdit#2: This boston globe article has a good summary of the situation at hand. A lot of people are saying that she has never identified as Native American, but that is contradictory to this relevant passage: \"In an interview with the Globe published last month, Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many of the matriarchs of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories and history were becoming lost. Ivy League universities, like the ones where Warren taught, were under great pressure to show they had diverse staffs.The University of Pennsylvania filled out a document explaining why it hired a white woman over minority candidates — clear evidence it didn’t view her as a Native American addition. And the Globe interviewed 31 Harvard Law School faculty members who voted on her appointment there, and all said her heritage was not a factor.\"So, while I don\\'t think it\\'s likely that her career has been significantly furthered by claims to Native American heritage, the fact is that she has identified as Native American historically. I believe that she should have addressed this in her video and been explicit that it was a mistake to ever identify as Native American. Also, before you comment, I would strongly recommend reading the two articles I have linked as they provide most of the information you need to know.

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\\'t generally go down well in MA. \\nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \\nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\\'s consider that she\\'s got no 2020 plans.\\nIf her seat is safe and she\\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\\'re beating on \"Pocahontas\" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MS), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \\nSo Warren\\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \\nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \\nThat\\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway. It makes more sense if she doesn\\'t plan on running. \\n', \"Hmm. Interesting take. I guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing. While I stand by my statement my moral objections to the way she went about this, I think that if indeed she isn't going to run in 2020 this strategy makes more sense. \\n\", \"\\nI guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing.\\n\\nI'm not sure how you'd go about a conditional delta, but if they made you see things from a different light, consider awarding an actual delta. Delta doesn't mean compete transversal and you don't have to wait around until 2020 and be 100% convinced to give it.\\n\", 'Just add !\\\\delta (without the slash), to the previous comment.\\n', 'My bad never posted here before\\n', \"I guess the moral component would depend on how successful the strategy is. If she can distract enough GOP hate to somehow help the Democrats win all of their competitive races and get back a Senate majority, she would have played a part in making sure that no more Kavanaughs happen between now and 2020. \\nIf you see that as a good thing (as she surely does), then you could argue that she's doing a morally questionable action for the sake of a larger moral victory. In the end, the extent of damage she does here is frustrating a percentage of the Native American community for a few months. If the strategy works and the Dems take the Senate, there's the potential to prevent things that are way more damaging than that. So you could argue that going for the strategy would be a moral good. . . in aggregate (if not in isolation). \\n\", \"Sure - I hereby award one !delta for giving me a new perspective. If it is the case that she is not going through with a 2020 bid, I believe that this might help other democrats in their respective campaigns by eating up news realestate that would otherwise be focused on them. Since Warren's seat is probably safe, the negative attention on her doesn't really matter for her personal political strategy. However, I don't believe that this was her strategy intentionally, rather, I believe this might be one positive consequence of an overall poor decision. I think it's more likely that Warren went through with this whole thing to advance her personal agenda rather than as some altruistic distraction. Furthermore, you mentioned the ND race - I think that's where this whole thing might be the most detrimental. If Native Americans votes are swayed by this whole thing or their enthusiasm is at all reduced, it hurts Heitkamp's chances.\\n\", 'I think the main strategic advantage of Warren’s decision is that it disarms one of Trump’s primary avenues of attack, name calling. Pocahontas has been Trump’s go to name for Warren for quite a while. If Warren brings up the million dollar donation every time Trump says Pocahontas she either galvanized her base by continuing to point out that Trump is a hypocrite or pushes Trump away from using that name. Either possibility is beneficial. \\n', \"Hmm.. I don't think Trump will stop using Pocahantas. I think he and his supporters will persist b/c in their eyes Warren is no more Native American than she was prior to the DNA results. Furthermore, the bet was that Trump would pay if the DNA showed she was 'an Indian'. Since you can't prove that with a DNA test as it is mostly a cultural/experiential identity, there is no way to win or lose the bet. Warren has legitimized the ridiculous bet by engaging with it and bending to Trump's requests. \\n\", 'The issue is that you’re looking too far ahead.\\nThe big hurdle for Warren to be president is getting on the ballot by winning the Democrat primary. \\nHaving the Trump base attack her, while simultaneously adding some validity to her ancestry claim gives her some credit in the eyes of Dems as someone the right hates and protects her from attacks within her own party. You’re not going to convince Trump supporters that she’s an Indian, but you might trick one of her primary challengers to fall for the bait of contesting her claim. If a Dem starts arguing that she can’t be Indian because she doesn’t have enough ‘blood’, the identity politics wing of the party will cannibalize them.\\nDefeating Trump is a matter of a lot of factors out of her control and more about how the Dems vs Reps mobilize and how current events and news sway voters. The primary is much more about her individually and where she needs to focus her efforts. This does that.\\n', \"Hmmm I'm not sure I follow your argument. So you think that this whole thing will benefit her in the primaries b/c a  another democrat might bring up the illegitimacy of her claims? I honestly don't see any democrat trying to touch this issue in a debate (the damage has been done and they wouldn't want to give her anymore room to soften the issue) and based off how left wing media is covering this I don't think it has won her many points with liberals. Perhaps the increased criticism from right wing media will drum up tribal support from democrats as passion begets passion, but I still think the net result will be negative. \\n\", 'Trump’s exact quote doesn’t ask her to prove tribal membership, but specifically mentions a DNA test\\n“We will take that little [DNA] kit, but we have to do it gently. Because we’re in the #MeToo generation so we have to be very gentle. And we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t injure her arm even though it only weighs probably two ounces. And we will say: I will give you a million dollars, paid for by Trump, to your favorite charity, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian.”\\n', \"Yes... and she wins the bet if the DNA test 'shows you're an Indian'. Since we have established that there is no definition of what would qualify as Indian, it is an impossible bet to win or lose. Different tribes have different metrics. It can show that she has a Native American in her ancestry, but that's not what Trump said. \\n\", 'Thats such a bs excuse. Especialy since hes said other times that he thinks she has less native ancestry then him, and he has none. \\nIf the same people that are \"pissed off\" at Warren kept Trump to the same standard he wouldn\\'t have made it out of the primary. \\n', \"But I'm not comparing Warren vs. Trump, I'm comparing Warren vs. every other 2020 hopeful. I believe that this whole thing has been a strategic blunder and is not the correct way to engage with Trump. This whole thing has made me less sure that Warren would do well 1v1 with Trump. \\n\", 'If you step back just a bit.   Warren liability is the Pocahontas’s thing,  Trumps liabilities dwarf hers.     It’s amazing this is presented as a debate of two equivalent candidates. \\n', \"I agree it's ridiculous, but that doesn't change the fact that it's important and I think Warren could have handled it way better. \\n\", \"You can prove you are Native American by DNA, if your percentage is high enough. You are indigenous to the US if you predominantly descend from the original inhabitants of the US. You can't be Native American solely by culture. Of course, this means Warren is not indigenous and just has some minute indigenous ancestry.\\n\", \"I should clarify - I acknowledge that the DNA test is good at showing what percent of your DNA is from Native American ancestors. However, there is no solid definition for whether or not someone is Native American. Short of being 100% genetically Native American, there are many different metrics used by various tribes to determine if someone qualifies. So what metric would be used in this bet? How could Warren win the bet? She can't b/c it's a nonsense bet made with no qualifications and whoever wins is completely arbitrary. \\n\", 'She herself clearly stated, she has native ancestry, but does not belong to any tribe and does not claim to have any status with any tribe. \\nIt\\'s only being brought up by conservatives as an attack because they have nothing else on her, but she is now bringing it up because it has been a perfect demonstration of how Trump lies and contradicts himself: years of calling her out on it and demanding a DNA test, offering a million dollars only to say \"who cares?\" and \"I never said that, read it again\" with numerous videos of the contrary. It further chips away at his credibility with those not an unwavering supporter.\\nFor someone who claims to be so wealthy to refuse to give (a \"small loan\" worth) to a CHARITY does not shine a good light on his character.  \\n', 'The point is that Trump calling her \"Pocahontas\" was a jab that assumed she was lying about her Native American ancestry for some sort of gain (although there is pretty decent reporting showing that Warren did not gain benefits from telling the truth on forms from the 80s that she had Native American ancestors).\\nIt isn\\'t exactly important how large a percentage of Native American Warren is, because the argument was never what percentage Native American is Warren. The question, as posed by Republicans including Trump, was whether or not Warren could realistically claim to have had Native American ancestors. According to the DNA results, she can.\\nMany people are now trying to shift the argument to be about the question about what percentage of Native American you have to be to claim to be Native, but that isn\\'t correct at all. Calling someone Pocahontas because it has racial overtones and almost sounds demeaning isn\\'t something to back down from. And even if the argument the whole time was that Warren doesn\\'t have enough recent Native American ancestors, isn\\'t that accusations enough by itself when coming from the POTUS to rise up and defend your heritage and family history? Why should any individual in this country be ashamed of their great great grandparents or their great great great grandparents just because of their ethnicity?\\nThose are a lot of words, but it is so wrong that any individual should feel ashamed for not burying their past. It isn\\'t that Warren actively promoted herself (although others ran a little wild) as a Native American, so shouldn\\'t we all be at least a little disgusted that anyone would attack her for just her acknowledgement that one of her distant ancestors fell in love with a Native American?\\n', 'You’re probably right about Trump sticking to Pocahontas. And you’re probably right that engaging with this bet legitimizes Trump’s words. But Trump is the president. His words have some inherent legitimacy or at least significance. If Warren can make people remember those words as a failed promise she made a sound choice.\\nI don’t think the minutia of Trump’s statement matters too much. Warren took a DNA test that validated the story she has been saying about her ancestry, the same story Donald Trump makes fun of. That won’t mean much to Trump supporters, but to people actually on the fence or Warren’s supporters it means She has been telling an accurate truth for years, which does seem meaningful.\\nIf Warren does decide to go for a Presidential run in 2020 I think the tactic of making Trump eat his words could serve her well. This seems like a first step in that kind of strategy. \\n', \"I'm have no level of respect for Trump, but the donation was based on proof of being Native American. A maximum of 1/64 Native American ancestry is not being a Native American anymore than I am French due to my mother's great great great great great grandfather being from France. The last one of my ancestors who considered themselves French died before the War of 1812.\\nElizabeth Warren is not Native American, she has no tribal connections, no cultural connections and no blood connections within the last century. Trump is very, very rarely justified in his actions but if I had made the bet I wouldn't pay out either.\\n\", \"> It gives the right a ton of ammo for attack adds and talking points. They can now say that Warren has benefited from her claim of Native American heritage while being scarcely Native American\\nWe're weeks into this thing and no one has shown that Harvard even has an affirmative action plan for Native Americans. In fact, all I can find on AA is that they lower test score requirements for students from poor, rural and sparsely populated areas.\\n\", \"I'm not making an assertion that she benefited from her claims to Native American history - that's actually irrelevant to my argument. I think it is pretty clear, however, that this whole thing has made it easier for right wing pundits to say that she has benefited. In the past, she has identified as Native American on applications (one or more times, i'm not sure and it doesn't matter). Thus, she has identified as Native American while having no real cultural or genetic basis for doing so.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a pretty minor issue. There's no evidence she tried to use this status to her financial benefit, to help her career, or that she identified as Native American in any other situation. Her colleagues and superiors say they knew her as a white woman. She never tried to obtain tribal citizenship or identify with any tribal nation in a legal sense.\\nShe claims she did it in hopes that she might connect with other people of Native American descent, since she knew it was part of her family history and wanted to learn more. You can believe her or not, but again there's nothing to suggest she used this to advance her career.\\nAs someone with experience in genetic genealogy, I would say her DNA results do in fact validate her Native American heritage. The report shows she very likely had a Native American ancestor 6-10 generations back. You might be thinking that's pretty far removed, but hear me out.\\nWhen this whole thing popped up during Warren's senate campaign, she talked about how her family always told her they were part Native American. Genealogists started digging and discovered that Warren's great great great grandmother was allegedly Native American (her name was O.C. Sarah Smith). There was no solid proof, but it seems to be a common claim passed down among this woman's descendants. If this ancestor was full blooded, that would make Warren 1/32nd Native American. However, genealogists seem to agree that she wasn't full blooded. If this ancestor was half Native American, that would make Warren 1/64th Native American, which would mean Warren is 6 generations removed from a full blooded Native American ancestor. This fits with the DNA test, so it's totally plausible this ancestor (Warren's 3x great grandmother) was half Native American.\\nA great great great grandmother is not as far removed as you might think. One of my great great grandmothers was still alive when I was born - I even have a picture of her holding me as a baby! I know all about this side of the family, because she lived so long. This is only one generation less than Warren's supposed Native American ancestor, so it's not unrealistic at all that the family might still be well aware of their heritage, and consider it to be a significant part of their identity. There would be physical traits, stories passed down, names... all of it eventually dwindling away generation by generation, but they still held onto the identity. If they openly shared this fact, it's not hard to imagine some unfavorable opinions when Warren's parents married in 1932.\\nJust like many Native Americans who assimilated into European-American society, Warren's ancestors left no paper trail. If they didn't want to to be persecuted or discriminated against, they would do anything they could to fit in without a trace. It wasn't until relatively recently that it became acceptable or desirable to claim Native American ancestry. There are tons of families just like Warren's, who don't have it documented, but know through oral tradition. You can put all kinds of political spin on it, but it's hard to deny there's something amazing about DNA backing up oral family history from at least 6 generations ago, and that's the main thing I take away from this whole issue.\\nIt's true that Warren is mostly of European descent, but at no point did Warren lie about this. Nothing she said has been proven wrong or even misleading... if anything, it's all been reinforced by DNA evidence.\\nOn the other hand, strategically I would agree with you. Republicans don't care about facts or science. They will build their own narrative, and Warren is just fanning the flames by responding at all. Democrats aren't going to win by arguing with idiots.

So \"nothing\" isn\\'t an option.\\nTaking a test and proving that there\\'s truth to her story at least takes the idea that she\\'s just lying off the table.

Let the other party continue to mock her, call her a lie, make up shit about her without responding at all? Try to give a civil answer? Because that\\'s what she was doing for the last 4 years.\\nWhat\\'s a better option than just definitively settling the truth, she\\'s has a tiny bit of native american ancestry, which is basically what she\\'s been saying the whole time.

She could have consulted with tribal leaders and people more knowledgable in this topic in order to publish her results in a way that didn't feel so tone deaf. While she never says she belongs to a tribe, she does say she has Native American heritage. While this is true, it feels very uncomfortable to make that claim without a large asterisk every time noting that it is a very distant heritage. She has also checked boxes (one box?) in her college applications identifying as Native American - she should have acknowledged that this was wrong and then emphasized that at no other time past that point in her professional career did she capitalize on this identity (which she did in her video, but without acknowledging that she had identified as Native American when she shouldn't have). \\n\", \"\\nIn her release video, she claims that the DNA results validate her Native American heritage. However, in the past, Warren has gone even further than saying she has Native American heritage - she has claimed that she is Native American. This is a big distinction, and to claim that you are Native American when you are likely less than 1% Native American, have never had tribal contact, and have never suffered any form of oppression that actual Native Americans suffer, comes off to me as overplaying a minority status for political gain.\\n\\nI don't think that is the case. I can't find any instance of her making this claim. I think that sometimes she may have abbreviated the term, but she never claimed to be Native American any more than by heritage. She has been pretty clear I think that her belief was based on the family story that her grandmother had Native American heritage, not even Native American herself. She never made any type of tribal claim at all.\\n\", 'Warren was identified by Harvard law as a PoC. Harvard promoted Warren\\'s hire as expanding their campus diversity by hiring a woman with \"minority background\" onto their faculty.\\nWarren submitted multiple recipes for the Indian Cookbook \"Pow Wow Chow\" and signed her name \"Elizabeth Warren - Cherokee\"\\n', 'Warren was identified as a Native American by Harvard’s HR department without her knowledge. She did not represent herself as Native American to Harvard at anytime and corrected the HR department as soon as she became aware of the error and stopped making the claim in any way from that point until the story broke 10 years later.\\n', 'What you are saying is untrue. *edit#2 as Blubox points out below, this is talking about her time at UPenn, not Harvard. It seems as though she truly may not have benefitted from the Harvard designation. *\\nWarren herself said that she embraced the status Harvard gave her because her \\'matriarchal family members were dying and she felt it was important to hold onto that aspect of her culture\". She definitely leaned into that title while she was at Harvard. \\nEdit: source - https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/10/15/warren-addresses-native-american-issue/YEUaGzsefB0gPBe2AbmSVO/story.html\\nAnd direct quote: \"In an interview with the Globe\\xa0published\\xa0last month, Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many of the matriarchs of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories and history were becoming lost.\"\\n', 'Yes - the premise of my original argument is not that she has necessarily benefitred from her claims of Native American ties, but that she has identified as Native American at all. She really should have addressed in her video that this was a mistake. Also, thanks for the article, I have included it in the original post. \\n', 'Do you not believe that Native Americans are oppressed? From the US census: \"to this day, Native Americans have the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the United States. The poverty rate of Native Americans is 25%\". This is almost three times the poverty rate of White Americans. \\n', \"No one has oppressed them in a long time, they are a product of their own culture as is every other race. To blame inequality on racism is just ignoring that there are massive problems in the semi segregated communities that native Americans construct. No one except fringe lunatics goes out of their house in the morning looking to disadvantage people that aren't of the same race. \\n\", \"You seem to have a pretty narrow view of what 'oppression' is. Just because no one is directly harming you doesn't mean you aren't oppressed. Blaming poor people for being poor because of their 'culture' is a racist argument and ignores the complex socioeconomic factors that contribute to and perpetuate poverty. \\n\", \"There's no way to prove this now, but she's playing the long game. By the time 2020 rolls around, no one will really remember the cultural upheaval this reveal caused. They'll only remember that her DNA test showed that she has a Native American ancestor somewhere in her bloodline. By getting in front of these racist attacks, the only thing left for her opponents to smear her with while she campaigns is her record as a senator. If anyone tries to jeeringly call her Pocahontas two years from now, it will stink of ignorance and desperation. People forget details. That's how many a politician holds power.\\nAlso this.\\n\", \"So I think it's fare to say that the reaction from Native American communities has been mixed. However, I think Warren could have done much more to minimize the fallout form this by having more conversations with Native American leaders. \\n\", \"I'd still like you to comment on the electorate's useful amnesia and how from a strategic standpoint, this will ultimately play to her advantage.\\n\", \"Oh yea - I guess I'm not really sure you can say the amnesia will work to her benefit or to her detriment. Will people remember that she has a native American ancestor or will they remember only that she is scarcely Native American? I guess I have no reason to believe one way or another, but I think it's safe to say that right now, both left and right wing media have been covering this story negatively. \\n\", \"Fair - I don't think this incident is disqualifying in anyway, just not helpful. \\n\", \"I don't understand why she can't be native American even if she's 1% and if some native Americans don't like the way she has gone about proving it. I don't see how her expressing how she feels about her identity is wrong, especially considering how consistent she has been in asserting this fact. And I mean what percentage point do you need to be native American or black or Mexican ancestry to be apart of that group, and if shared experience is important and someone had no opportunity to access those shared experiences, like you got murdered as an infant, would you not be native American, or what would happen if you got murdered and were only 49 percent native American there is almost no way you could be native American, people just emotionally can't handle white people who feel related to oppressed minority groups, she has a right to feel this way, white people are allowed to be confused too, and she has a right to announce it any way she wants. If people don't think this next presidential election is going to be an off the rails reality show, then buckle up cuz this will be inconsequential by the time the race is over. Career politician won't win she's already lost\\n\", \"I agree that identity is messy messy business. Where do you draw the line? Who is cultural enough for a culture? However, there is a line somewhere, otherwise anyone could claim minority status and we would be very difficult to tackle issues like racial inequity. I'm not sure where this line is, but I know that Warren sure as shit is very far from it based on both her culture and her DNA. \\n\", \"\\ntaking a DNA test so Trump would either donate 1 mil or look like a jackass\\n\\nThose are not the two options though. Trump donating 1 mil was never in the cards and no reasonable person thought it was. Furthermore, this DNA test doesn't make Trump look like a jackass: he is already full jackass in the eyes of liberals. Rather, the DNA test gives him and right wing pundits evidence that Warren has a vast majority of white/European heritage. \\n\\u200b\\n\", \"The president should be held to his words.\\nAnd I think you're looking wayyy to into it honestly. \\nAnyone who's left wing won't flip because of it, and anyone who's right wing won't feel more validated because of it, they don't care already. \\n\", \"You may think this is not a big deal, but this is the type of stuff that can turn off many centrists.

Saying that her parents needed to elope to be married because one of them was “too Native American” when they would still be at best average. Saying that she knows they were Native American because of the high cheek bones... \\n', 'To comment on your second point: \\nHas Elizabeth Warren ever been the primary person responsible for bringing up her claims of Native ancestry in a political context? As far as I am aware, she has always done this in response to someone pushing her on it. This doesn\\'t strike me as the behavior of someone looking to play \"...on her minority status for political gain,\" as you say. \\nThis whole business about releasing her DNA results, in fact, can be considered a response to a direct challenge by Scott Brown a couple years back. Scott Brown, as you may remember, was a major player in the original iteration of this whole controversy some eight years ago during Warren\\'s original run for US Senate against Brown.\\nFinally, I want to challenge the notion that she has \"...never suffered any oppression that actual Native Americans suffer.\"\\nFirst, she is an actual Native American, both in terms of family lore (not under question), and now due to result of her genetic background. That she is not registered with a tribe is a separate issue from her self-identifying as having Native ancestry.\\nSecond, her lived experiences and her family stories have shown that she was brought up in a lower middle-class upbringing, and that she did indeed face hardships as a teenager. A further point is that, whatever your opinion of it, affirmative action is not just meant to help a person out because of their direct struggles--it is also meant as a means to rectify generations of past disadvantages suffered by one\\'s whole family. It can take generations for a family to come out of poverty, for example, and to the extent this issue (or similar issues) faced Warren\\'s family, then even if she had used her Native ancestry for political gain (which I do not think she did, but that\\'s a separate question), then that still may have been appropriate\\n', \"Multiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered Native Americans and her parents told her they eloped because her paternal side of the family did not like that her mom was part Cherokee/Delaware. That sort of thing does impact how you form your own identity and affect how you view race.\\nThere hasn't been a single colleague of hers that has come forward and said she was hired because of affirmative action. \\nNative Americans groups have been on every side of the issue because they agree it's also hard to verify native ancestry by the paper trail as well , but don't want members of their tribe kicked out over DNA tests which Elizabeth Warren has said she is against.\\n\", \"\\nMultiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered Native Americans\\n\\n\\u200b\\nDo you have a cite for that?

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\\'t generally go down well in MA. \\nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \\nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\\'s consider that she\\'s got no 2020 plans.\\nIf her seat is safe and she\\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\\'re beating on \"Pocahontas\" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MS), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \\nSo Warren\\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \\nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \\nThat\\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway.
