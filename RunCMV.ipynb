      "To illustrate this, let's take the business cost of literally anything else.\n",
      "Let's say, you own a fleet of trucks as part of your moving business.  It costs so much to keep the gas tanks full and to keep the fleet maintained.  These costs are more or less fixed. Would it be in anyway a good argument to insist that others pay for half of your gas and maintenance because you can't afford to stay in business and pay these costs? Probably not.  You would likely tell this hypothetical business owner to manage their efficiencies.   The business owner should charge more, use more efficient routes, or use fewer trucks.  He should not expect others to maintain his fleet.\n",
      "There is no way that outsourcing these costs is good for the economy. He's using resources inefficiently   These trucks and their labor can be used more effectively elsewhere.  If the business owner cannot figure out how to pay for the fleet, then it is best for everyone that he shut his doors.\n",
      "The same logic applies to your workforce.  It costs so much to feed and house them.  Using their saleable labor, but not paying adequately for it, causes a net cost to society.  You are using their labor inefficiently.  You are making other people pay the difference.  The only reason employers get away with this is that we tend to have more compassion for our fellow humans than a fleet of trucks.  \n",
      "Now, you may say, \"any job is better than none at all\" and that allowing people to underpay labor and making up the difference is better than having to pay all expenses for an unemployed person.  To that I say, we invest a lot in our (human) resources as a country. There is a vanishingly small number of people who truly cannot produce enough to earn a living wage.  Our economy is efficient.  The gains of that need to be shared, not taken as rent. \n",
      "I do have one caveat though.  I think it is probably okay to have a tiered minimum wage.  ie: you may pay minors less to give an incentive to hire them and provide work experience.  This could also go for perhaps the first year of total work experience of any given individual, regardless of age. \n",

At some point this will cause there to be too few jobs available for humans.  I'm just afraid that once the elite can no longer get anything of value from us, that the only thing they will desire from us is our absence.

If the price of rent is raised, and moving isn't an option, then they have to pay the price or be homeless. Maybe barracks are an option since we are talking about the military, but this can happen to anyone not just people in the military.\\nI know it's fun to make fun of stuff on the internet and I am a jackass more than my fair share. I think it's bullshit what the US military gets used for, but that doesn't make the struggles of people in the military irrelevant. They die, deal with tons of stress, mostly make shit money, get crazy high levels of PTSD, etc. So you can make fun of and hate the politicians that force people in the military to do through stuff, but hating the actual people in the military is uncalled for.\\nIt isn't like they can just quit either.

It's designed to help them pay for housing, not for tuition or groceries.\\n\", \"It was raised to actually cover housing, because before it wasn't covering housing. It still does not cover housing, but it would if they hadn't raised the price to leech it.\\n\", \"The fraction of rent which is a monopoly price and increases with residents ability to pay, the economic rent of land, is not set directly by land owners. It is the result of a natural law of economics known as Ricardo's Law of Rent. The law states that the rent of land is the difference in productivity between the location in question and the least productive location in use. Giving students more housing assistance money will not necessarily decrease the cost of rent relative to their income after subsidies, because it does not decrease the difference in productivity of living close to campus vs living farther away from campus. It does not decrease the magnitude of the advantage which a land owner who holds title to the land immediately adjacent to the campus has over land owners who hold title to land further away from campus.\\nIn order to increase affordability, it would be better to invest in expanding public transit and shuttle services, to decrease the magnitude of the advantage which those owning land closest to the college have. The best way to fund public transit is through a land value tax, as 100% of the burden of a land value tax is paid for by landowners, and none of the tax is paid for by renters. That is to say, it is the only tax which land owners cannot pass on any portion of to renters, for good economic reasons which David Ricardo discusses in detail in the book 'principles of political economy and taxation', in which the Law of Rent was also published.\\n\", 'What a sick cycle we live in. I wonder how much of this money the landlord is actually profiting. Are their costs going up somewhere or it’s just extra income \\n', \"well, this is how markets work. there are two distortions that make the market work improperly here. first, demand was made inelastic by the captive renter pool created and paid by the college. second, supply is probably artificially restricted by city ordinances. the situation could be corrected by adding more housing supply, either by the college building more dorms, or by allowing a private company to build a new apartment building. this would give the landlords competition and they would have to lower prices. the situation could also be eased the college didn't admit more students than the existing infrastructure can support. this isn't the fault of the landlords; it's the fault of of the city and college by preventing natural market forces from taking place.\\n\\u200b\\nif you're selling widgets for $10, and your entire customer base gets a raise and is willing to pay $12, why would you sell your widget for less than the market will pay?\\n\", \"For every dollar of federal funds like the Pell Grant that get disbursed, college tuition increases 63 cents.  \\nthis whole idea of 'free money' just doesn't ever work\\n\", \"While this sort of minimum wage increase has negative consequences for employment numbers and commodity pricing which can have knockon effects to housing, that isn't REALLY what you argument is about, so I am not going to address it further.\\nIf everything your argument was premised upon worked, the real issue would be the provision of housing.\\nPeople/corporations build housing, or purchase and rent housing, to turn a profit. Only governments build housing 'altruistically' and it almost universally ends up as a slightly better or slightly worse ghetto.\\nThe pressures to keep housing costs down actively dissuade the construction of further housing, making the cost of purchasing or renting accommodation extremely difficult due to supply:demand issues - see: London, New York, Vancouver, or any similar large city with substantial social housing provision - all have catastrophic supply/demand problems.\\nYou attempt to address this by tying the wage to the housing price, but this simply results in a runaway minimum wage increase trying to keep up, which results either in untenable inflation or the utter death of industry as employers move somewhere where they can actually afford the workers.\\nThis problem is fundamentally caused by low-skilled jobs being available in abundance in cities, where housing demand exceeds supply causing high costs. Housing affordable on minimum wage exists, just not in big cities. Trying to 'force' minimum wage to be liveable in large cities does nothing, as it completely fails to address the supply/demand issue.\\n\", \"I don't think the solution is to build more housing. We already have far more empty homes than homeless people. I think people should just deal with the fact that they don't get to live in the dead center of New York, and people who do live in the dead center of New York will have to accept that they can only go to higher end stores because that's all that will hire in the area. \\nThis means that McDonald's can't operate on minimum wage in the center of New York, which I honestly think is a good thing because it drives the prices of fast food up in that area specifically, which is good because it means people will accept the housing price cut easier if it means they can buy a cheeseburger from a greasy teenager at 3 in the morning. \\nI think if there's a massive housing shortage in an area, people shouldn't move there. Sorry if you want it, it's unavailable, you can't always have what you want.\\n\", \"You are certainly right on housing, but the key then is to get people to live outside of the cities, rather than tying wages to house prices. In fact, your first and third paragraphs here run directly counter to the main premise of your argument, in my opinion - sorry if you want to live there, but it is simply too expensive.\\nMcDonald's can operate on minimum wage because of the level of government support they get in the form of welfare and subsidised housing. Without this, workers would not be able to live close enough for the jobs to be economically feasible, forcing McDonald's to either not operate there or raise wages.\\nIf McDonald's wants to operate in the middle of NY without said subsidies and without a wage increase, the labour pool would be effectively limited to transients and students, which gives those people a job instead of no job, and some work experience which translates into a 'proof of concept' as them being a capable employee on their CV.\\nThe 'problem' with your argument is the expectation that someone should be able to live in New York on a McDonald's burger flipper's wage.\\n\", \"I agree that people should be spreading out of cities, population density in cities is a whole other host of problems. \\nI'm saying that McDonald's shouldn't be able to operate anywhere they can't afford the workers. Welfare and subsidized housing is a band aid, and putting a band aid on the problem won't solve it. The idea is that McDonald's will have to choose between closing operations in places they can't afford to operate, which gives local businesses less competition from shitty companies so they have the space to flourish in the market, or McDonald's can put pressure on the housing market to make housing more affordable, which helps to reduce the incentive to profit off of owning property that you're not using. \\n\", \"People should absolutely NOT be spreading out of cities.\\nIf biodiversity is going to be maintained, we have to preserve a lot of space where there aren't people, neither buildings nor agriculture. Cities also allow for efficient transport that will help get rid of casual automobile ownership. Cities can certainly be designed better, especially with more roof gardens, balconies and other types of outdoor space for people to enjoy, but we as a species do not want to encourage suburban living. That eats up farmland, promotes automobile use and highway construction, and removes habitat.\\nIf you want to fix urban housing issues, make it less profitable to own property there. That means fixed rents/rent control, multiplicative taxes per unit owned, and ban AirBnB/casual subleasing.\\n\", 'Δ I agree with most of what you said and think it makes more sense than parts of what I said. \\n', 'Have you considered that you are looking at the issue from one angle, while another perspective exists? You approach the problem from the position of control, \"They should be allowed to.\" In used to approach issues like this in a similar way. I\\'ve found that a much more productive approach is to ask \"what incentives has the government created that companies and people are logically capitalizing on? And how could things be changed to adjust those incentives?\" The control approach sets up a whack-a-mole situation where you have to keep layering more and more control to deal with those who find the loopholes in your original control  scheme.\\n', \"I don't think that these perspectives are mutually exclusive. \\n\", 'Yes, all of these things are true, but none of them support your initial argument that the minimum wage should be somehow tied to housing costs.

This ignores the fact that the majority of workers these companies could or should employ are not paying all of those costs - a student working a student (burger flipping, for instance) job is almost certainly not paying housing and all other costs. Forcing the wage to be at a level where the workers can be paying for housing practically guarantees that the jobs will disappear or become increasingly automated, leaving these people unemployed rather than working a job that doesn't pay them enough to 'live' fully.\\nFurther, raising minimum wages does not only harm 'shitty companies' like McDonald's - it does, in fact, apply to all of the other businesses operating in a similar market segment, making them equally inviable.\\nReducing the incentive to profit off housing you 'aren't using' reduces the number of rental properties available directly - someone needs to own the property to rent it out. Reducing costs otherwise reduces future housing stock. Fixing housing prices in any way leaves you with the social housing 'trap' that many in cities like New York and London face, where they have a subsidized or rent-controlled accomodation and could not afford to live elsewhere/pay market rates, and would lose the subsidy if they earned more.\\nI think you have correctly identified the problem, but your solution doesn't solve what you think it will solve.\\n\", \"When the minimum wage was set, it was intended to support a family of three with a single breadwinner.

Real estate is one of the longest term investments around with the property taking potentially decades to turn a net profit from its initial construction. Therefore, as a property owner, it's in your best interest to charge as much as is feasible for your product so you can turn a profit. And don't forget, most rental properties are mortgaged just like regular homes, a big chunk of your rent ultimately lands in the bank's coffers, not your landlord's.\\nIn regards to point 2:\\nThis is actually closer to the the current model for a lot more housing than you may realize. Most lenders require that rental properties are insured prior to renting it out. This means that for the majority of properties, especially for new construction, they have to pay not only the mortgage payment, but also insurance and maintenance costs. The average single family rental property is lucky to make $400 profit in a given month, reduced even further when a property manager has to get involved to manage the 20+ property portfolio required to make a living solely off rentals. In other words, even on the high end of profitability, they're actually only making about as much as an engineer in terms of the amount of work required to manage the property in a given month.\\nIn regards to point 3:\\nThe minimum wage is scaled off of outrage more than anything an economist has ever said. It's a direct driver of inflation and is, at its core, a band-aid solution to a much more complex issue. The cycle of the minimum wage tends to go like this:\\n\\nMinimum wage is increased\\nBusinesses raise all wages up to some variable cutoff point to keep the near minimum wage earners from having their own fit due to the devaluing of their work\\nBusinesses see their new bottom line and start making cuts in employee hours or layoffs to make up for inflated labor costs (most businesses operate on small profit margins)\\nEmployees that get hours cut go home with the same or less than they were making previously while layoffs have trouble finding any employment as every other  employer has taken these steps\\nDepending on how much the wage has risen, people either survive the joblessness through unemployment benefits or go homeless (see S.F.)\\nEventually, due to increased wages, inflation starts to rise as the lowest rung of the productive economic ladder is making more\\nHousing rises with inflation as the true value of the land owners profits diminish\\nBusiness is making more money due to the increased revenue brought on by inflation\\nBusiness hires new employee\\nEmployees realize that everything is more expensive than it used to be. (inflation devalues their work after all)\\nBack to square one.\\n\\nEssentially, from an economic standpoint, a minimum wage earner is of a certain value to the wider public. Currency is a physical manifestation of the value society places on your labor/product. Changing the currency doesn't change the value of the work it represents, therefore, everything else will adjust proportionally given time as nothing has changed in terms of the value of the work to society.\\nIn regards to 4:\\nThe reality of the situation is that any increase to the minimum wage causes harm to some (via reduced hours or layoffs) for the benefit of others (the lucky ones that dodge the layoffs and cuts). California took this to the extreme with its minimum wage hikes driving people to record levels of homelessness. If you want to affect real change, then you need to either make minimum wage earners more valuable to society or make them worth paying more than minimum wage.\\n\", 'why are banks allowed to own all the houses\\n', \"Allowed? The banks aren't allowed to own the houses, they're just one of the few establishments that can take on a multi-decade investment. We're talking about taking a loss for over 20 years on a 30 year mortgage.

Therefore, the best practice is to take the bank loan, then skim a little off the top for themselves.

Let\\'s break them down.\\n\\nwithin reasonable transit distance from the job\\n\\nWhat is considered \"reasonable\" transit distance? Is this based off of any mode of transportation or a specific mode of transport? For example it may take you 2 hours to walk to work, but just 15 minutes to drive. If we\\'re basing this off of public transit, how will this work in smaller towns or cities where there is no/limited public transit available. \\nI\\'m also curious as to how this would be implemented. Depending on how \"reasonable\" is defined, you could end up having a minimum wage that varies between neighbourhoods  the same municipality.\\nI\\'m also not entirely convinced this would be free of abuse. What\\'s stopping someone from taking a job in an area with a high cost of living(such as a downtown core or affluent neighbourhood) while living an \"unreasonable\" distance away in a poor neighbourhood and pocketing the significant difference? For example, in New York City,  the average rent in Tribeca is $4,000 per month while the average rent in Morrisania is $1,200 per month. If we broke down the wage by neighborhood, according to your guidelines Tribeca would have a rough minimum wage of $67 per hour while Morrisania would have a rough minimum wage of $20 per hour. What exactly is stopping someone from taking a job in a place like Tribeca, living an \"unreasonable\" distance away in a poorer community, and pocketing the significant difference in wages tied to rent costs?\\n\\nsafe single-person suitable housing \\n\\nHow is this defined? Will certain neighbourhoods be off limits due to crime rates exceeding an arbitrary level? What constitutes single person housing? Is it a basement/main floor? Studio apartment? One bedroom apartment? These all have different costs and quality of life associated with them. \\nSimilar to reasonable distance, I feel as though people could also take advantage of this. Having two roommates living in a 2 bedroom apartment/basement/floor/etc will usually bring the per-person rent costs below the costs of renting an individual one bedroom, sometimes by a considerable amount. This, like a slightly longer commute, would yield considerable higher monthly take-home while only marginally reducing the quality of life of the renters(if done correctly, that is). \\n\\nLocal business will pressure landlords to keep housing near their businesses affordable, so\\n\\nThat\\'s not really how rent prices are determined, and there\\'s not much a local business can do to \"pressure\" a landlord into keeping prices down. With the exception of legislated rent control, rents are determined by the demand and supply of rental housing in a given market. \\nWhat would occur in such a scenario is the movement of businesses from wealthier areas to poorer areas to take advantage of the lower wages. This could also lead to companies implementing corporate housing schemes in order to avoid higher wages in these wealthier areas. \\n\\nThe cost of housing will trend toward slightly above the cost of maintaining that housing\\n\\nThe cost of purchasing and leasing property will likely increase alongside such a significant increase. You would be increasing demand for property considerably(by giving more consumers money) while the supply would stay relatively constant in the short term(houses aren\\'t built overnight). In the long term, construction costs would likely be higher as well, meaning the cost of building housing would also increase.\\n\\nAnyone who holds any job will be able to afford safe shelter for at least long enough to find a better job or get some education, which will increase stability and reduce the homeless population using the market instead of using public services as band aids \\n\\nThis would likely increase the homeless and unemployed population as businesses close which are no longer profitable at the current wage levels. Small, sensible increases generally do not have a major effect on the economy, but you are proposing a major national change that could see wages in certain areas quadruple overnight. The cost of this to an employer would be far greater than you\\'re imagining. \\nFor example, a business with 5 full time employees earning $10 per hour currently would cost that business around $104,000 per year in direct wage costs. However, if the minimum wage in this area was increased to $20/hr(average one bedroom apartment $1,200), this would increase the wage costs of that business to $208,000. While some businesses would be able to succeed due to their necessity, many would simply fail in the short term.\\nAnother issue facing businesses would be the increased competition between different communities/neighbourhoods. Because of the extreme discrepancy in wages in some areas, how could a business based in Tribeca possibly compete with one offering the same goods/services in Morrisania, for example? \\nFinally, and perhaps the most notable reason as to why this is not a reasonable proposal:\\n\\nYou need housing in order to not die of exposure. This makes it easy for landlords and property managers to behave in predatory ways toward their tenants, for example raising the cost of housing on lease renewal by exactly the margin that the company their tenant works for has increased their pay. The landlord, doing no additional labor, is now getting that worker\\'s raise.\\n\\nWhat exactly is stopping this exact scenario from transpiring indefinitely and repeatedly following your proposal? If landlords are currently willing to increase rates based on increased rates at work, why wouldn\\'t they be willing to increase their rates once your rates go up significantly?\\nThe other interesting issue is that you seem to be going after business owners in an effort to prevent predatory landlords, which doesn\\'t really make sense to me. If you\\'re in favour of widespread legislation such as this, surely something like rent control(which directly deals with landlords) would be preferable. While rent control is not without its drawbacks, it does seem to be a much better solution to this issue than major changes to the minimum wage. \\n', \"If a person wants to work for a certain amount of money and a business is willing to pay them that amount then who are you to say that they aren't allowed to say that that mutually agreed upon transaction should not be allowed?

There were of course a small percentage of people comfortably sitting in their minimum quality housing eating cheez its and being sad, but that's going to happen under any system. The only people who worked less in these studies were new parents and students, who were working less to devote more time to their education or to their growing families. Countries with a social system that guarantees at least housing and basic necessities are affordable via the minimum wage still have plenty of doctors and lawyers and business owners, who still chose to do those things because they wanted to and had the freedom to make that choice.\\n\", \"\\nMany people don't move up because they can't afford the education\\n\\nLet's start off with something real easy.  over half of all minimum wage people are college students or high school students.  These people are already working to get their skills higher by having a minimum wage job.\\nWhen you take the rest, of those, most are part time workers.  Meaning these are second incomes.  Either a second job or a second family income.  \\nThen you have another subset of people who are incapable of complex work, like people with Downs or other learning disorders.\\nThe vast majority of people earning minimum wage are not struggling adults who have no skills.  People who are working minimum wage this year that aren't mentally incapable or teenagers, are usually not working minimum wage next year.\\nYou don't need education in order to improve your skills and earn more than minimum wage.  \\n\", 'Your premise is just plain wrong - minimum wage is not the same thing as “support me and my family wage”.  Minimum wage jobs are for low/no skill, and are NOT (and should not) be intended to be the kind of thing you can live on!  This kind of silly thinking is what gets automation (can you say order kiosks in fast food places?) and other things!  Get an education, work hard, and get a real job to live on!\\n', '\"in early 1938, the FLSA introduced sweeping regulations to protect American workers from being exploited, and created a mandatory federal minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in order to maintain a \"minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency and general well-being, without substantially curtailing employment\".\"\\n\\nAutomation is going to happen regardless, and was always going to happen regardless, and companies framing it as a punishment for people asking for a living wage are saying so as propaganda to prevent the growth of unions and an effective labor movement\\n', 'Can small business owners keep up with these costs?? \\n', \"Small business owners are usually mostly paying their own family so yeah, actually, if they can keep a roof over their own head they're typically making these costs.\\n\", 'This is one of the policies that sounds pretty good on the surface, but starts to get very complicated very quickly. \\nHousing prices are fairly variable even within cities and you would probably end up calculating multiple minimum wages for individual cities. This would make a complicated system for both employees and employers. \\nAlso housing is not the only good that costs more in an urban environment. A minimum wage should account for a general cost of living for an area. \\nSo I agree housing is definitely a consideration , you can only set so many wages as a policy maker. In the U.S we already have set higher minimum wages in states with higher costs of living in most cases. I think a helpful start should be setting a city versus rural wage to adjust for the cost of living. \\n', \"Can you cite a reference for your definition of minimum wage.\\nMinimum wage was never intended to be a living wage to support a family.\\nIt is an entry level wage for new members of the work force, college students that work part time, seniors on social security and so on.\\nA minimum wage employee making $7.25 per hour, costs the business closer to $20.00 per hour, with mandatory health care, employment taxes and other employer matched taxes.\\nThat's $160.00 per day that basic duties do not rate.\\nForcing employers to pay a higher minimum wage will simply mean that employers will hire less employees and pay the ones they do hire less.  Other jobs will simply be come contractor positions where the contractor is paid very little and is expected to cover self employment and income taxes.\\nMany will not pay and just pocket the money.\\nEnd result, less employees, lower wages for all and a dramatic reduction in tax revenue.\\nFor a shining example, see the city of SeaTac, Washington.  Mandatory $15.00 minimum wage.  Hundreds of exceptions, of course, for cronys and contributors of other sorts.\\nEnd result, virtually no minimum wage earners in SeaTac.  Those workers come from, and are paid by companies in the surrounding communities.\\nSo, for the sake of the rest of us, please force this through your local municipality, county, or state.  The rest of us will benefit greatly by your abysmal and dramatic fall.\\n\", 'When you add a tariff one of the things that happens is domestic producers of products being taxed raise their prices.\\nHealthcare and education both exhibit similar behaviors.  Government decides people must have a thing and costs rise.\\nWhy would this proposal not do something similar?\\n', \"The market will automatically fix problem by itself. Imagine this, in a city like San Jose, one of the most expensive place to pay for housing. Any business operating here will have to pay their employees enough to at least rent a house. If they will not pay enough, they don't have the ability to retain their employees, so they will have to relocate to a less expensive area. Once enough business leaves an area, employees leave with them too and the demand for housing drops. As a result, the housing price will drop too. But on the other hand, if the business is successful like the one in San Jose, the housing price will stay up or even increase.\\nIn addition, if employees don't have enough to pay for housing and they end up becoming homeless. It makes the area less desirable. As a result, housing price will drops, area becomes a ghetto and businesses leave the area. When enough people leave the area, new residents will come in for the low prices. Business will the pick up again. A good example of this is Detroit.\\nThe problem with this is that the market needs to take time to adapt. But with the internet and more transparent salary / housing prices, this problem can go away.\\n\", 'You’re right.

Because of this, rent is scaled up in the area (and even surrounding areas). If the minimum wage was raised to a standard you’d expect, all independent businesses (like the locally famous HRD) would go out of business. And even larger, more corporate restaurants  would choose to remove locations, as the cost over takes the profit, and the business would fall out of the black. Basically, this would unintentionally support a hyper capitalistic system, and remove small business even further than its being removed now.\\nEdit: a few typos \\n', \"I see how this would be bad for places that already have a segment of the population making good money alongside a segment that isn't, and how the pay would not scale to let people who are already making a lot of money stay at a higher ratio\\nΔ for the social problems this may cause that I haven't considered in that people want to be better than other people and will have tantrums when they're not. \\n\", 'I’m probably too late to the game here but the real minimum wage is zero.

When you have a good or service that is relatively finite in nature, the price of that good or service is dictated by the number of goods being sold and the number of buyers buying - we call this supply and demand. If supply drops relative to the number of buyers, the price increases. If supply increases relative to the number of buyers, the price decreases.\\nRaising the minimum wage increases the number of buyers, but does nothing for the supply. I think you might retort that supply more than covers the number of buyers, given the number of vacant homes in the US, but this logic is a bit flawed, since people live in cities, not countries. What this basically means is that those vacant homes are not in direct competition, are not a part of the under supplied markets. The existence of vacant homes in Oklahoma is not going to drive down housing prices in NYC or Vancouver.  \\nTo be honest, I think you answered your own question when you said: \\n\\nThis makes it easy for landlords and property managers to behave in predatory ways toward their tenants, for example raising the cost of housing on lease renewal by exactly the margin that the company their tenant works for has increased their pay.\\n\\nIf the tenant is working for minimum wage, gets an increase, then the landlord would raise accordingly, right? \\n', 'I think it should be the other way around and rent should factor depending on minimum wage (if I have to choose one). I’m all for dunking on CEOs but at least they arguably do something besides own land and charge people for the right to survive in the most predatory ways possible.\\n', \"I'd argue that we should be dunking on both, yeah a CEO does not earn all their wages but a landlord isn't doing NOTHING, they do have to manage the property and handle the legalities/utilities/organizational work that most tenants don't even know needs to be done. \\n\", \"A lot of people have attacked the minimum part of your argument but I would like to challenge the varied part. Lets assume the plan works great and cities with high cost of living like NYC sf And la all continue to boom under the new system. People have more money to spend and all the great things proponents of minimum wage argue will happen,  happen. What will happen to smaller less attractive cities. Right now the biggest incentive these cities have is a low cost of living. In some places the minimum wage can stay the same and still meet your requirements. So now no one is moving to low cost areas because it doesn't matter where you live. Small cities then lose more people and more have less resources to try to improve. With a flat minimum wage that's just barely at the col in expensive areas smaller cities have one advantage that allows them to draw people into their area. Why struggle at the poverty line in New York when you can live comfortably in Rochester at 15$ an hour?\\n\", \"\\nI believe that the minimum wage should be equivalent to the after tax, take-home pay that is needed to pay rent for safe single-person suitable housing within reasonable transit distance from the job, and that this amount of money should be earned in under 60 hours per month (15/week)\\n\\nSo if we take San Francisco as an example: The average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is $3334. You'd suggest that the minimum wage vor SF would be $55/hour AFTER taxes + $x/hour for groceries and other costs? \\n\", \"Minimum wage shouldn't be tied to any outside factor.  As you increase minimum wage, sellers of goods will simply increase the price of necessities to match the higher minimum wage and you are back at step one.  \\n\", \"this does not happen in most countries with a higher minimum wage\\nif people have money, they still don't want to spend all their money on bread, and they sill still choose the cheaper options, and the cheaper options will still sell better.\\nalso, what factor should it be attached to? you're saying that it shouldn't be connected at all to how much money people need\\n\", \"\\nthis does not happen in most countries with a higher minimum wage\\n\\nDon't those countries also have a higher cost of living on top of that as well though?\\n\\nso, what factor should it be attached to? you're saying that it shouldn't be connected at all to how much money people need\\n\\nYou can't attach it to the cost of something because those costs can easily change or be manipulated.

The unemployment rate is also 5% currently in Australia. \\n\\u200b\\nI dont think minimum wage could ever be tied to housing prices, because what happens if there is suddenly a housing bubble crash?

Minimum wage is simply the lowest someone is allowed to pay an employee. It is not intended to being a living wage. Minimum wage places a minimum price for your labor. \\nWhen a company sells you a product, you want it as low as possible. You don't care about whether the company can survive when selling at that price. The product is only worth a certain amount to you. The government fixing it's price in order to keep the price high enough will not save a failing company. If their product is worth $50 to you, the government fixing the price of that product at $60 means you simply won't buy it. \\nThink the same about your labor. A company only values your hours at a certain price. The government mandating them pay more is gonna make them lay off people. \\n\", 'There should be no minimum wage.

People thought the government backing student loans was great. College for all right? Well the schools knew the money was a lock and all of a sudden tuition skyrocketed. Now who students not only have to fight for jobs they are stuck with that loan debt that can't be bankruptcy. Did it help some students get an education? Sure. Did it make the college's rich? Absolutely. Could we have done something better to ensure a proper education that left the student without a mountain of debt? I think we should have tried something other that petting the government fiddle with it. Same with min wage. The market should determine pay scale not the government.

This idea, in fact, covers both of 'walmart moves in nearby' and 'the business owner is not good at running a business' - smaller business can thrive in niches providing better service or more specialised services than massive 'one-size' providers like Walmart. If an independent provider is trying to operate in an identical space to Walmart or McDonalds, they are, by definition, not good at running a business.\\nIndependants might pay higher on average for whatever reason, but the wage increase you are proposing would still impact them massively - the difference between the minimum wage and a 'living' wage would almost certainly more than cover the difference between the current minimum wage and whatever modest increase on that independents currently provide within a similar market segment.
