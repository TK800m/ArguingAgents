0,chadonsunday,"​Fairly self explanatory. I don't particularly care which way it goes on this, but I feel when it comes to insurance rates and protected groups I think it should be all or nothing.My understanding is that auto insurance companies use various markers when determining the rates for those they insure. Currently age and sex are two such markers: a 16-25yo male, for example, would be more expensive to insure compared with a 30-40yo female. They arrive at this conclusion by running the numbers and finding that young males get in more costly accidents more often than older females (or even younger females) and therefore end up costing the insurance company more, so charge them more.I find this rather baffling since age and sex are classes that are federally (E: federally in the broadest sense, but more specific protections exist by state, like ones specifically regarding public accommodations or business establishments; many states have also massively increased the number of protected groups. All this to say that ""federal"" isn't crucial to my view here) protected from discrimination. Charging someone more for the same service (insuring their vehicle) because of their age or sex seems like quite blatant discrimination. Ideally, I think these markers should be removed (and insurers can fall back to the many other non-protected markers they currently use, such as driving records, miles per year, area of residence, etc.) OR all protected classes should be fair game. If insurance companies can crunch the numbers and determine that men are more costly to insure than women, and young people are more costly to insure than older people, surely they could do the same when it comes to race/ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, etc. It may turn out, for example, that whites get into more accidents than blacks, and insurance companies could charge them more just like they currently do based on age/sex metrics. Again, I don't particularly care which way this would go, but logical consistency seems to be a bit lacking in the current system.I think this issue is a bit more significant than other frequently discussed examples of discrimination (e.g. the wedding cake for the gay couple) since driving an automobile, while not a right, is much more significant and essential to many people's lives than their ability or non-ability to use any baker they want to get a cake. Also, while insurance companies are private entities, the government requires that you be insured if you want to drive. I think this issue is more akin to similar conversations regarding the ACA and how and why it's unfair (and perhaps discriminatory) for women to have to pay more for health insurance (even though they're more costly to insure).One counterargument that I won't find particularly compelling: differences between the sexes (e.g. testosterone causing more aggressive driving) or ages (e.g. brain development makes you drive better). These arguments are very likely true, but when it comes to discrimination of whole groups the ""why"" is irrelevant to me. In part because I could see how some similar ""why""s, if studied, could easily be extended to other protected groups: perhaps one ethnic group tends to have a slower reaction time than others; perhaps pregnant women drive more erratically due to hormones; perhaps parents on average get less sleep and sleep deprived people don't drive as well, etc. But more importantly, even if all of these things are true the whole point of not discriminating is that you can't assign certain characteristics or abilities to whole groups of people (many of them numbering in the hundreds of millions or even billions) and then treat every member of that group on that basis even if you have data suggesting those traits are on average more common among members of said group. This is unfair because averages aside you have no way of knowing, just based on the data alone, if individual members of those groups actually have those traits (e.g. it's perfectly possible that a male can be cautious and responsible get through his 16-25 range without so much as a parking ticket while a woman in her 30-40s can reckless and be getting into accidents every other month).TL;DR: What auto insurance companies are doing is essentially a form of profiling, using a couple protected classes as a basis for discrimination. If that's the way they want to go, I don't see why they're just limiting themselves to two when they could profile even more accurately by using all of them. Or, we can acknowledge that they shouldn't be discriminating against protected groups at all and age and sex should stop being markers for insurance rates.Edit: I feel I was a little too careless in my use of legally-charged terminology, and some folks corrected me on that. I've awarded some partial deltas for that further down. Going forward the only view left to change is my main one: it's fucked up for auto insurance companies, as the providers of a near-essential and legally required product, to be discriminating based on sex and age alone. They either shouldn't be doing that, or all other metrics (religion, race, etc.) should be open for auto-insurance discrimination, too.Y'all know what to do.

I did make it rather clear in the OP, though (and in many other comments here) that I\'m well aware of that. I\'ve used such things to my advantage in the past. \nMore to the point, your latter paragraph is exactly what I\'m trying to get at, here: if insurers were found out to be using race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. (even if they were backed by cold, hard stats) to determine insurance rates, there would be a fucking outrage. Which is why I\'m baffled that they\'re allowed to get away with the exact same practice when applied to sex and age. Some things aren\'t justifiable when it comes to garnering outrage; if your driving record is a mess because you total a car every few years it makes perfect sense that the insurance company would charge you more. Just the fact that you possess a penis, though? Really? That\'s a justification for charging more? I get that it\'s statistically backed, but other metrics (race, religion, etc.) could be statistically backed if they were studied (and in some cases they have been, like that perhaps blacks speed more (and more egregiously) than other racial demographics), too. \nBut yeah, people would throw a fit if the group harmed by what another commetor (who is an auto insurance agent) termed ""determining risk factors"" was a POC group, or female, or gay, etc. The fact that they\'re just discriminating against young dudes seems to somehow make it okay. I think there should be outrage that they\'re doing that OR we as a society should acknowledge that this kind of data can be studied for all groups (just as soundly as it is for age and sex), and insurance rates might raise or fall on that basis. Personally I\'m cool with either one, but it seem to be we need to pick a side. Logical consistency demands it. If insurance can be sexist, it can be racist, too. If insurance can\'t be racist, it can\'t be sexist, either. Insurance companies shouldn\'t be able to say ""well X and Y groups are totally fine to study and discriminate against... but groups A, B, C, and D are totally out of the question."" They should either study (and insure differently based on that) groups A - Z or they shouldn\'t study (and insure differently) any of those groups at all.

They should pay the same. \n', ""Alright. But that's my view; either insurance companies shouldn't use things like age, sex, race, religion, etc., OR they should use all of them.

I have absolutely no idea what the kind of differences in driving would be between, say, races or sexual orientations. That said, I'm fairly certain you don't either. And that said, the reason why the insurance companies aren't investigating this data isn't because it isn't financially beneficial to them (it might be or it might not be) but rather because they can't. That certainly doesn't mean that such an investigation would be impossible, or that it might not make money for the company. \n"", ""I get what you are saying, but insurance is based on odds. The odds of young males getting into more costly accidents are higher than older females, therefore they pay higher rates because they are more likely to need more money for accidents. Just because you are a good driver doesn't mean the next young man is, so it uses a generalization of odds to determine rates. Health insurance does the same thing.\n"", ""Right. I'm in agreement with everything that you wrote. My point, though, is that it's a little odd for insurance companies to only be using age and sex out of all of the protected classes when they could easily run the numbers for religious groups or races etc. and charge more or less for those metrics, too. I think all demographics should be fair game or none of them should (exempting the ones that really make sense in this context, like your actual driving record). \n"", ""Overall, I don't really have any qualms with what you're saying, I just think you're putting too much focus on it. I think the biggest flaw here is how important race and religion is to risk for the insurance company. \n\nthey could easily run the numbers for religious groups or races etc\n\nThat's absolutely right. Similarly, they could also run the numbers for favorite TV shows, favorite podcasts, and favorite music. From that they could find that those who listen to classical music have fewer accidents than those who listen to rock or rap. But this would be largely redundant as far as a rating factor goes. Insurance companies already take into consideration the zip code, the credit score, the occupation, and education of clients.\nWhile those who listen to classical are safer than those who listen to rap and rock, the difference between someone who has a different music preference in the same zip code, credit rating, occupation, and education would be very minimal. Do you see what I mean? A Beverly Hills lawyer, who listens to rap, would have a nearly identical rating as a Beverly Hills lawyer who listens to classical, verse a Compton dollar store employee who listens to rap vs classical.\nConversely, age and sex can NOT be expressed through zip code, credit, occupation, or education. A college educated 40 year old woman in Beverly Hills driving a 2018 BMW is a lot lower risk than a 16 year old Beverly Hills boy driving a Beamer. And a 16 year old Beverly Hills girl is a lower risk than the boy.\nSo, while I agree with you they could take race and religion into account, they could take a lot of things into account also, but it wouldn't make a significant difference with all the other risk factors that already use- while age and gender actually do make a huge difference on risk factors.\n"", 'So I hate to be ""that guy"" but do you have any sources for this (i.e. the whole rap vs rock listeners thing)? I mean, it makes a lot of sense that the difference wouldn\'t be that great (and perhaps not significant enough for insurance companies to bother tracking) but I\'m going off nothing but my gut and own anecdotal experience (I noticed my driving calmed down quite a bit when I transitioned to NPR and podcasts on my drives as opposed to metal and techno), here. \nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s actually true or, even if the margins are fairly small, that it wouldn\'t be worth the company\'s time to track and measure. Even if it\'s just, say, a $3 a month difference, the largest auto insurance company, State Farm, insures 44,000,000 vehicles. Multiply that by twelve months a year and the $3 difference and you\'re looking at a ~$1,500,000,000 metric the company isn\'t capitalizing on. Just a little thought experiment. \nSo yeah. Maybe sex and age are the biggest factors (aside from the big, non-""protected"" ones like your actual driving record). But just because other factors aren\'t as big do we have any proof they\'re not worth the company\'s time? In short, are they not gauging insurance rates based on race because race is virtually irrelevant, or because they can\'t legally? \n', '\nSo I hate to be ""that guy"" but do you have any sources for this (i.e. the whole rap vs rock listeners thing)?\n\nNo, there\'s no actuary data for this.\n\nBut just because other factors aren\'t as big do we have any proof they\'re not worth the company\'s time? \n\nNo, there\'s no direct proof that it\'s a large or small issue. I\'m just using deductive reasoning since differences is race largely disappear when controlled for by intelligence and income, which is highly correlated with credit, zip code, occupation, and education.\nDo you think there\'s a significant racial difference in the way people drive that can\'t be controlled for by intelligence and income? And why do you think it\'s an equally relevant factor for age and gender?\n', 'You have to remember what insurance is. The nature of the business is to assess your risk and give you a rate that doesn\'t bankrupt them when you make a claim. \nFor that reason, insurance ""discrimination"" is regulated by the government and they must have credible statistics for their rates. \nRegardless though, your view is that they shouldn\'t at all and I disagree. \nImagine you\'re a singer who smokes heavily, can the singer claim an insurance company is discriminating against smokers? Or is the insurance assessing the risk of them paying out a claim? \nNow I know, age sex and race are biological. But insurance companies need a baseline. From the baseline it can go up or down based on your driving record and accident records. \nWithout a baseline, insurance companies can\'t guarantee they spent their money well. Without a baseline, insurance companies would almost be less inclined to insure because they are taking on an unknown risk. \nI know it doesn\'t seem fair and you\'re right about that. But the business would hardly exist without statistically assessing their risk to begin with. \n', ""\nRegardless though, your view is that they shouldn't at all and I disagree. \n\nNot quite. My view is that if age and sex are fair game for assessing risk then every demographic metric (religion, race, orientation, etc) should be fair game, too, OR insurance companies should only use metrics that make sense in this context (like driving records). \nAnd insurance companies can get a baseline either way; they can get that baseline using just data from driving records and mileage and grades and such OR they can make it even more accurate than it is now by including religion, race, orientation, etc. \nKind of my underlying point here, though, is that if they started factoring even just race into insurance rates tomorrow (even if they were based on 100% credible statistics) people would flip shit. In much the same way the ACA made a moral argument for why women shouldn't have to pay more for health insurance even though there was credible statistics showing it just made good sense for why they should have to. I think insurance companies are getting somewhat of a free pass on the two categories I've focused on because they're discriminating primarily against young dudes. If they were discriminating against POC, homosexuals, or Christians something tells me they would've been forced to abandon those metrics a long time ago after much outrage. And my point is that I don't really see a difference in these metrics. If you can use sex to determine insurance rates there's no reason you can't use race, religion, orientation, etc. And if you don't think insurance companies should be using those latter metrics, it's equally unfair for them to be using sex and age.

These are similar examples, and are completely legal.\n', 'I work for an insurance company as a programmer and have worked extensively on the parts that do ratings. Age and sex aren’t the only things taken into account, there are a lot of things that go into determining risk. We have an actuarial department whose sole job is running statistical models and crunching numbers to determine risks and factors. \nSo for drivers here are some of the primary things we take into account:\nAge\nSex\nMarital Status\nInsurance scores\nDriving history\nViolations - only count things less than 5 years old and things like 21+mph speeding ticket is weighed more than less than 20\nDrivers age when licensed (less experience driving = more risk)\nSome companies use credit scores also\nI’m not in actuarial, but an unmarried 23 year old male is riskier to cover than a 23 married male.

Often times they will come back and say we don’t like how you weighed that item or the amount you charge for that coverage. There are a lot of rules and regulations that we have to follow around rating. So until the department of insurance will allow us to use other factors, we are stuck with the age/sex/marital status as part of the formula for how risky a driver might be or not. \nEdit: In typing all that out I missed a big point. We aren’t discriminating against people, we are determining risk factors in how much we need to charge this person to break even in case they get in an accident. When an accident costs you $30k to cover somebody, but you only charge them $2k a year in insurance, you are taking a bet that while with you, they won’t get in an accident and cost you more. \n', 'Hey, glad to have caught the attention of a industry professional! I was hoping that might happen. Thanks for the insight. \nIn regards to your first five paragraphs (based on what you said in the sixth) I think you realized that I\'m not unaware that sex and age aren\'t the only metrics that auto insurers use. I\'m aware of many of these factors, and have used them to my benefit in the past (like when I was able to walk to work every day my insurance was lower than it is now with my 2.5hr round trip daily commute, despite me being several years older now than I was then... and it makes sense; on the road more = more of a risk). \nSo to hone in on your last paragraph (let me know if I\'m skipping over anything in the former ones that you\'d like addressed), I\'d argue that you are both discriminating and ""determining risk factors."" They don\'t have to be mutually exclusive. For example, if a bar found that white folks were statistically more likely to steal from the bar, start fights, waste employee time, etc. and decided to charge whites more for drinks for those reasons, that would be both discriminatory and ""determining risk factors."" I don\'t think it needs to be explained, especially to you, why it\'s determining risk factors, but it\'s also discriminatory because the stats you have don\'t say a damn thing about any individual white person who enters your bar - it says something about white people on average. Treating all whites in a special and certain way because of statistical realities that individual whites might not conform to is discriminatory. Some better examples might be things like an employer not hiring women because they\'re statistically likely to get pregnant and want maternity leave. From a company bottom-line standpoint that\'s just ""determining risk factors""... but it\'s also discrimination. Or perhaps you, as a landlord, have data that shows green people are more likely to trash your property, throw loud parties, and upset other renters; not renting to green people would just be you calling a shot after ""determining risk factors""... but it would also be discrimination. \nMore to the point, your data that shows males are more costly to insure says something about men, but not about me, per se, or my buddy Jeff, or my girlfriend. It\'s totally possible that both my gf and Jeff are horrible, reckless drivers, but I\'m not. Out of the three of us your discriminatory assumptions are only true for Jeff... because while your stats say something about ""men"" and ""women"" they don\'t say anything about me or Jeff or my girlfriend. We\'re all individuals. Treating individuals of a group in a certain way because of the assumption or factually based data that indicates some/most of them are more prone to X is essentially the definition of discrimination. \n\u200b\n', 'I think we need to adjust your definition of discrimination: Unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people. I would argue that determining risk factors based on statistical data is neither unjust nor prejudicial. \nSo to give you an idea of how the rating works, everyone starts off at a 1.00 at a base level. \nLapse in coverage? Your risk factor increases by 1.21. \nLow credit score? Increase it by 1.9 \nLess than 5 years driving experience? Increase it by 1.3. More than 5 but less than 10? Increase by 1.2 instead. Over 10? Increase by 1.00.  \nGood student? Increase by .90 (this results in a decrease). Driver training? Increase by .90. Defensive driver? Increase by .90. \nSingle male between 27 - 29? Increase by 1.408, married male between 27 - 29? Increase by 1.100\nTake all the risk factors multiplied together to get the final risk factor. Now for each coverage take the base premium and multiply by the risk factor. This is of course an over simplified example of how rating works, but I wanted to point out that gender and age only play a small role in these factors. The primary time it is weighed more than other factors is the 0 - 24 age range and the 75+ age ranges, but these are offset by individual risk factors decreasing from good student, driver training and defensive driver (no at fault accidents).  \nA lot of what we can use is limited or required by the Department of Insurance, and the crunched numbers and statistics show that age/gender/marital status is the most reliable model we can use. It might feel unjust that your factor is higher because you are a single male under age 24, but if the statistics clearly show that 8 out of 10 drivers in that category are a higher risk of having an accident and you have 20k drivers in that category on your book of business, you know you have a high chance of having to cover 18k accidents. So you have to charge more to cover that cost and it isn’t unjust for a company to do that. Is it prejudicial against you? Not really, it is a small part of the rating factors, and there are discounts to offset the group factor based on individuals. \nThis is where the bar analogy fails, a bar makes drinks, it costs them x amount to make said drink, and they charge based on that. The bar has insurance to cover the other items. Their cost of insurance is built into the cost of the drink. It would also be counter productive to a bar to come up with such a pricing schema because they want to turn over drinks fast, so if your bartender is having to calculate out complex pricing algorithms based on individual risk factors, drinks won’t be turned over quickly, and the bar will make less money. \nOther institutions that I’ll throw out that use factors in making decisions based on groups that might seem discriminatory are collages for admissions and banks for loans, just to name two. \nIf you could name a better model that is realistic for determining risk factors for thousands of drivers that you barely know anything about that doesn’t dig down into getting extremely personal, I would love to hear it.

I was raised as a Christian in America. I\'m well-read in western philosophers, and I currently describe myself as a secular Buddhist. I will explain what Buddhism has provided for me that western philosophy has not.\nThe short version is: Buddhism offers specific, practical advice about what actions to take to improve your human experience.\nFirst, let me talk about how Buddhism has made me more loving and kind. It doesn\'t take a philosophical genius to figure out that we ought to do good to others. I was taught that as a Christian, I read about that in Plato and Kant, etc. Buddhism explicitly describes actions I can take that will enhance my ability to be loving to others. In short, I make a conscious effort to reorient my thoughts to be more loving to others, even when I would naturally feel otherwise. In addition to doing this in my daily life, I take time occasionally to meditate explicitly about my feelings of love for myself and others. There is no doubt in my mind that this has made me a better person.\nNext, I\'ll talk about how Buddhism has helped me avoid feeling depressed or annoyed while instead finding more joy in the little things. Secular Buddhism as I practice it is based on mindfulness meditation, which allows me to understand the world as it really is. By taking 20-30 minutes a day simply experiencing that, ""This is what existence is like,"" I come to better understand how all pains and pleasures are ephemeral and how ideas like self and other are human constructions rather than fundamental features of reality. I am now better able to perceive the sound of people chewing, previously a tremendous source of annoyance for me, as merely sound empty of any meaning or feeling. Because it is empty of feeling, I do not identify with any annoyance thereof.\nI have read some people argue that secular Buddhism isn\'t actually anything new. Modern neuroscience is enough to tell us that the self is an illusion, modern acoustics is enough to tell us that the sound of people chewing is empty of meaning, and cognitive behavioral therapy teaches us how to consciously reorient our thoughts to become more loving. And that\'s all true. Honestly, if it weren\'t for acoustics, neuroscience, and CBT, I would never have bought into Buddhism in the first place.\nWhat Buddhism has given me, above and beyond what western science and philosophy has, is a plan of action. Having implemented that plan in the last six months, I\'m satisfied with it so far.\n', 'I\'m gonna ignore the inherent subjectivity in a lot of what you said, because you didn\'t really compare ""Asian"" and ""Western"" philosophy in many meaningful ways (I\'m sure plenty of people don\'t find much utility in the writings of Plato, for example).\nRather, I\'m gonna focus on what your view seems to be of ""usefulness"" in philosophy. Just because you don\'t find anything personally useful in those philosophies doesn\'t mean that learning about them is pointless. When you learn about Buddhism, Daoism, etc., you\'re learning about the cultures that they came up in and shaped, and thus gaining a greater cultural knowledge of the world, which is in itself useful.\n', ""I've found the Hindu pramanas to be relatively interesting and useful for organizing evidence in support of logical argument.  They are more comprehensive than Aristotelian logic and (to me) more accessible than more modern Western epistemology.\nFrom Wikipedia: Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six pramanas as correct means of accurate knowledge and to truths: perception (Sanskrit pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), comparison and analogy (upamāna), postulation, derivation from circumstances (arthāpatti), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof (anupalabdhi) and word, testimony of past or present reliable experts (Śabda).

Conversely it also advises rulers that if they want to keep their jobs they need to treat their people well. While this might seem like captain obvious to you, the modern western, you have to understand that throughout human history there have been societies hell bent on conquest, rising and falling within a century with countless dead and cultures lost to antiquity. Chinese culture has endured thousands of years with social upheaval usually sparked by ecological disaster. After all, Laozi teaches nothing about drought, except to perhaps die. Which in all honesty is unreasonable as it is against the most base human instinct. The modern world, especially the west, very much follows Laozi. People are well fed, are permitted to be who they want and are content in ignorance. Isn't this better than murdering each other over imaginary truths or who are the most devout followers of an imaginary omnipotent being?\n"", 'The most useful, practical and impactful lessons I\'ve learned were from Buddhism.\nThe Buddha taught that suffering comes from wanting impossible things. It comes from wanting your parents to never die, or wanting your significant other to love you forever no matter what. It comes from desiring people you have no control over to behave in a specific way that suits you.\nIf you can teach yourself to stop your desire for these things, to stop making your happiness conditional on these things, you can spare yourself so much suffering.\nA parable that described it well was about a man who came to the Buddha complaining about a terrible pain in his hand. He was holding a hot coal. The Buddha told him that the coal was causing the pain, and he needed to let it go. If we could all see so clearly how our actions are causing ourselves pain, we would be able to let go very easily. Because it doesn\'t make sense to hurt ourselves.\nThese lessons resonate with me, and they\'ve helped me change for the better.\nIt\'s possible that lessons like this exist in Western thought. But the concept of ""letting go of desire"" is a distinctly Buddhist teaching that many westerners need to hear.\n', ""Buddhism as a philosophy, is very compatible with western scientific thought, so I don't really see your point...\n"", ""So you don't see any potential risks with just discounting an entire half of the world's philosophy? No potential net loss of material? They're over there just spouting bullshit for some reason?\n"", ""There's a saying in middle-Eastern philosophy/religion that a prophet is not honored in his own turf. (Pretty sure this tradition has moved west and been adopted in Europe fairly widely.)\nI think you have a real point about truth being accessible to all people across the world, and your own local traditions of philosophy containing the same truths, packaged differently. Laozi sounds a lot like Plato, regarding the ideal versus the real (even though the alchemists that claim devotion to each have taken wild tangents in different directions). Bodhidarma knew his way around the inside of his own mind, but then again, so did Loyola.\nThe point of looking to some foreign tradition, in my opinion, is that it can dress ordinary truths up in an air of the exotic, and make us aware of things that would otherwise be too obvious to notice.

2,iucking_fdiot_,"My entire life I've always eaten bagels of all kinds, regardless of the toppings (fillings?) in a closed face manner. In fact I truthfully never even saw anyone eat a bagel open faced (2 individual halves) until my wife did it, and I couldn't understand how anyone could do that. Isn't the whole point of a bagel to be eaten closed face? Eating it open faced would just lead to everything on the bagel sliding around everywhere, making a huge mess, and reducing the enjoyment of said bagel. Furthermore, eating a bagel open faced means you would have to hold it by the edges, getting whatever is in the bagel on your hands, while eating closed face allows you to hold from the top and bottom of the bagel, eliminating this. I could maybe see something plain, like a plain toasted bagel, being eaten open faced, but if you're going to add toppings, it needs to be closed faced. My final thought on this, perhaps the way bagels are eaten varies based on geographic location, and this is entirely a product of where I was raised. I won't say specifically where, but I was raised in the suburbs outside New York City, if that has any bearing on the style of bagel eating.","['DeltaBot', 'huadpe', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'huadpe', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DeltaBot', 'DoomFrog_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DoomFrog_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DoomFrog_', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'Salanmander', 'DrKomeil', 'ElBlancoDiablo22', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'mfDandP', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'DeltaBot', 'cacheflow', 'PronunciationIsKey', 'draculabakula', 'cptnhaddock', 'iucking_fdiot_', 'ktsportsgirl']","[""/u/iucking_fdiot_ (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""I am also from the NY suburbs, and eating open face bagel halves is incredibly common here.

As opposed to a Closed Face style I would only have 1 bagel's size worth of bites.\nNext there is the 'Sandwich Pinch' effect.

When I'm with my gay friends I'm far more likely to tell a joke about the gay experience than when I'm with my family. Because they'll get it. \nThe second however comes from a toxic idea that men shouldn't have feelings, especially around other men. This kind of thinking hurts men and I'd say it's a sexist constraint on them. Now maybe we can agree you're not being intentionally sexist but the ideas of society that men are emotionless and stoic is a sexist idea towards men.\n"", 'I guess this stems from my personal experiences. For example, I am more likely to bring my emotional problems to my mom because she has always been easier to talk to about that. I love my dad, but we just relate to each other in other ways.\n', ""You mention that you're looking for ways that it might have a harmful effect on others. Well, the fact that you're less likely to talk about emotions with guys doesn't necessarily indicate overt sexism on your part, but it does have a harmful effect. The idea that men don't want to talk about emotions leads to men being less likely to talk about emotions, and it's a cycle of self-fulfilling stereotypes. Your tendencies are a tiny piece of that puzzle, and have a small effect towards keeping that cycle going.\n"", 'Your analogy/anecdote bears a strong resemblance to what many women refer to as “toxic masculinity”, primarily the latter part of your analogy, in regards to being more emotionally accessible and open with a female versus a male (ie your mother vs your father).  From what I’ve been told by women, a characteristic of this multifaceted issue are men who feel the need to disguise, stifle, or ignore their emotions for fear of being perceived as weak or inadequate somehow by their fellow males.\nThe raunchy male jokes are a social aspect that comes with the territory of being a male, and being a man comes with its own unique experiences, just like being born female has its own respective trials and tribulations.  Neither are inherently bad or good. They’re special in their own distinctive yet positive ways. \nMen are always going to lead vastly different lives than females, in every way, shape and form. Being wary or apprehensive to discuss certain things in the presence or immediate proximity of women isn’t inherently sexist, society just says it is, since we are so used to having distinctly male and females spaces. \nSocially, I think we are on a path towards gender neutrality (personally not my cup of tea, but more power to you if that’s your sort of thing) and once that day and age arrives, you won’t have to deal with or worry about the possibility of appearing sexist or the potential social stigmas that could occur from discussing certain subjects around females. \nHope this helped you answer your question. \n', ""And yeah it makes sense, because society has conditioned them to be more like that. And it's this conditioning that's sexist. I'm not saying it's wrong for you to talk to your mom over your dad, only that in the long run we should seek to eliminate the conditioning that makes it easier for basically every person to talk to their mom about that stuff than their dad. \n"", 'You\'re literally discriminating based on sex, so it\'s sexism. Whether it\'s respectful or derogatorily, it depends on the person. \nIn the first scenario, I\'m anatomically female (though it\'s a gray area whether I identify as a woman), and I am comfortable with penis jokes. In fact, another friend and I make penis jokes, randomly say penis cus lol and leave graffitis of penises in inappropriate places. If I was with you and a bunch of male friends, holding yourself back from making a joke about penis is not necessary and will make me feel like my presence a party pooper. It\'s about as frustrating as the notion that males shouldn\'t curse in front of females. \nIn the second scenario, I don\'t think there\'s anything necessarily wrong with preferring to talk about something personal and sensitive to certain people. If they all  happen to be a certain gender, that\'s fine too. However, I don\'t think it\'s healthy to only share or feel comfortable sharing a specific gender. \nBut isn\'t it better to just consider it on an individual-by-individual basis?

It's a physical thing. The second one isn't sexist per se, but it does suggest some unnecessary discomfort with emotional intimacy with people of the same sex. That isn't a great thing because you are locking out half the world from that level of friendship.  \n"", 'I agree with the last part but I also think it is somewhat natural. For example, moms tend to be the emotional support for children while dads tend to offer other things\n', ""My experience in the world is that men are entirely capable of emotional complexity, intimacy, and support. Moreover, it is my experience that they are much more fulfilled when they don't pretend like they aren't capable of these things as some sort of false bravado. I'm not saying you have to throw all cultural norms out the window, but Bros can absolutely share a common language of emotions and support. And in fact, life is better when they do. \n"", ""We tend to think of these stereotypes as natural. But there's not any scientific evidence that men are naturally less capable of feeling than women are, or of listening and supporting. We haven't discovered any genes that can predict these behaviors reliably, or any brain areas that differ between men and women that might predict a difference in those behaviors between men and women.\n"", 'The pattern of behavior you\'re describing does negatively affect women (and men). Let me be very specific about what I mean here.\n\nIn the same way, I am much more likely to talk about emotions with a close female friend rather than a guy friend because I just feel awkward talking about stuff like that with my guy friends.\n\nThis is an extremely common experience for men, who, frankly, are taught that having vulnerable emotions like sadness, anxiety, or fear in front of other men will lead to them being viewed as weak, ""not a real man,"" or a ""pussy."" Men are taught that it\'s important to be rational and unemotional, that being emotional is not manly. Some men learn in high school that talking about emotions like these can even lead to getting bullied or being physically harmed. So they learn to bottle it up, to not speak about these feelings at all or at least not with other guys. When they do go to someone to open up, it is quite often the women in their life.\nThis leads to a situation where a lot of responsibility falls on to women to help men get their own emotional deck of cards together. This, right there, is an inequality in emotional labor. But quite often men don\'t open up at all--their emotions come out in other ways. Men are at a much higher risk of drug or alcohol use disorders. Men are also much more likely to act violently. Quite often, taking drugs, taking risks, or acting out are ways of expressing distress for men who know no other way of venting their distress. Again, the victims of these behaviors are sometimes men and sometimes women. That is a clear negative effect.\nMore broadly, the way we think about emotions as feminine and rationality as masculine has negative implications for the way we think about career options, who is supposed to raise children and stay at home, who should be good at math and science etc...\nSo while the preference for talking about emotions with women is a relatively small preference in the grand scheme of society, it does reflect and contribute to sexism.\n\u200b\n', ""Sexism - characterized by prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.\nYou are stereotyping on the basis of sex.

If you're saying it's okay to not talk about women about penises, you're close to justifying not going to a female urologist based on sex, thus basically preventing females from becoming urologists - a rather well paid profession. While not overwhelming, it's certainly somewhat oppressive to force women out of a certain profession.\nEDIT: Yes women also need urologists - urologists generally spend more time with male patients b/c urologists also function as sexual/reproductive health physicians for males (similar to ob/gyns for females).

They say that anyone who says that it matters who is saying something and where and to whom matters is being sexist or racist. That\'s nonsense.

Do you think actors have something at stake by not showing their movie?\nThe issue is that distributors and other, larger entitles, who have a hold over distribution in other areas don't let these things happen because they don't get paid.  If I made a movie with Big Studios Inc. in America and wanted to stream or show my movie in Germany, it might very well be that a company that owns Big Studios Inc. does not have the right to do so in Germany.

Many companies choose to not go international with some of their products because they don\'t think there is a market for it. Plain and simple. You have to see it from their point of view. Is it worth investing in the necessary licensing agreements and avenues to allow for an international market to purchase your product even if the consumer makes up a small percentage of the population? Look at anime for instance, a small percentage of the US population actually watches anime and probably an even smaller percentage of that population probably watches the subbed versions.

5,Daviedou,"I recently read an opinion post on the telegraph (I believe - apologies if I'm incorrect) that talked about how the #metoo movement have made men afraid to ""make moves"" along with the Kavanaugh case made me think more critically about the whole movement. Up until this point I've been fairly supportive of it with few criticisms of it.I should also probably mention that I personally think the base idea/concept of the #metoo movement is simply great. Bringing attention to an issue that has for a long time been either considered taboo or been avoided. To this extent I agree with the message behind the movement. I think the men who have been exposed with good, reliable evidence deserves what they get in the aftermath.Here are my two main problems with the movement:
Firstly like the opinion post suggested I believe that men have become a lot, lot more careful about the advances they've made. Sure, it could be argued that this is good and I'd agree if that only applied to men who otherwise had intended harm or who wouldn't have understood the idea of taking it too far or men who simply disregard consent. My issue is the men who mean well, who are respectful of women and their rights, bodies, and limits. Not only do I feel personally that global movements such (mainly) as #metoo have made not only myself, but other friends a lot more scared to make moves (not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time) a lot more afraid to do so, but I know that a lot of men and women too who believe this. Between friends and myself I know women who have outright told us they don't understand why we haven't ""made moves"". I should probably also mention that before the push for movements like this and in general otherwise my friends and I as well as others I've spoken to about this are really quite confident so I wouldn't argue that we lack that.My second problem with the movement is that it can harm men who are innocent. I wouldn't ever argue in favour of a man who has committed sexual assault or god forbid rape, but I fear that men who are called out falsely on these claims stand to lose their otherwise good reputation, even if they are found not to be guilty. This second problem isn't one where I can necessarily back it up with evidence or events of this happening, yet it is my belief that this is definitely a possibility with cases of this probably already existing. In fact I remember in the past year reading about false accusations of men linked to the #metoo movement, although to be honest I couldn't at this very time (although if I can when I have a bit more time I'll try) give any examples of this, sorry.Please change my view, like I said overall I believe in the idea of making subject matters like this more open and less taboo, but I think this movement in particular can and have made men afraid and can harm them.Thank you :)","['DeltaBot', 'kublahkoala', 'Daviedou', 'kublahkoala', 'Daviedou', 'racercowan', 'KanyeTheDestroyer', 'Daviedou', 'ethan_at', 'MathBrush', 'Daviedou', 'Milskidasith', 'Daviedou', 'BolshevikMuppet', 'Daviedou', 'CoyotePatronus', 'Mite033', 'Daviedou', 'tempaccount920123', 'Daviedou', 'jazzarchist', 'Daviedou', 'haikudeathmatch', 'Daviedou', 'ProfessorLexis', 'Daviedou', 'ProfessorLexis', 'alxndrmkhl', 'Daviedou', 'CoyotePatronus', 'Daviedou', 'CoyotePatronus', 'blueandazure', 'AnActualPerson', 'blueandazure', 'AnActualPerson', 'blueandazure', 'DeltaBot', 'hastur77', 'Daviedou', 'BolshevikMuppet', 'little_bear_', 'OhhBenjamin', 'Daviedou', 'OhhBenjamin', 'miguelguajiro', 'scottevil110', 'Daviedou', 'DeltaBot', 'PreacherJudge', 'themaskedserpent']","[""/u/Daviedou (OP) has awarded 1 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", 'As a man, I know I’m much more likely to myself be a victim of sexual assault or rape than I am to be falsely accused. I’m about as likely to be falsely accused of rape or sexual assault as I am to be falsely accused of burglary or attempted murder, and being falsely accused of those crimes just doesn’t take up any of my brain space, so why worry about false rape accusations? \nWhereas I actually know and am related to men who have been sexually abused and raped — my father was raped by a priest when he was a boy, and my brother was sexually assaulted by a man in high school. This was years ago, and I’d like to think the climate now has made it so that if it happened today, they would feel comfortable reporting these crimes. The #metoo movement isn’t just about women — men are also very rarely believed when they are sexually assaulted, and #metoo is changing that perception.\n', 'I\'m sorry but I totally disagree with you. Firstly to tackle your second point - I don\'t think men are comfortable coming forward about sexual assault or rape. It\'s easy to say anyone nowadays would come forward but realistically probably not, especially as a man. I wish this wasn\'t the case but I don\'t think men are ""comfortable"" reporting the crimes, perhaps a bit more than before but not significantly.\nTo your first point, I never made the argument that being falsely accused has a higher rate of happening than sexual assault or rape, merely that the movement has made an environment where women feel as if they have enough safety behind the movement to make false accusations without repercussions.\nAppreciate your response but it certainly hasn\'t changed my mind\n', '\n, merely that the movement has made an environment where women feel as if they have enough safety behind the movement to make false accusations without repercussions.\n\nDo you have any evidence that women are doing this more frequently than before?\nI never said that men are now comfortable talking about their own sexual assault. But the fact that we’re having a national conversation about does make it easier for them to come out. The only reason I know my brother was assaulted was because of #metoo — everyone was talking about it, so my brother was like “Well, while we’re talking about it...” \nEven if feminists don’t intend for #metoo to help male victims, it does.

The other day a woman called the police on a young school boy for having touched her inappropriately on her lower back. CCTV footage shows the boy walking past him and his big school bag accidentally brushing against the lady. The lady never spoke to them prior to calling the police and never considered that maybe it wasn\'t sexually charged (i.e. an accident). If they hadn\'t had the CCTV footage in the store this boy or his mother/father could have easily been blamed for something they hadn\'t done.\nThose were just a few but I could give you more if you\'d like.\nYes you did ""I\'d hope the climate today would make them comfortable to report these crimes"" (referring to sexual assault and rape) is the words I believe you used. Coming out Vs talking about it? I\'m not sure what the difference is, could you clarify?\nI\'m glad people like your brother came out because of it, and that is one of the many many positives.\nI don\'t really like most modern day feminists for various reasons (although I strongly believe in equal rights). But you are correct I never said the metoo movement doesn\'t help men, although it mainly helps women, merely that it can also harm men.\n', 'I\'d have to scrounge up the post, but one of the side bars on a men\'s rights sub had a post about the subject of false rape allegations. Try checking out this post and tell me what you think. You can basically ignore my next paragraph if you read this.\nBasically, you\'re more likely to actually get raped as a man than be accused falsely of rape.\nMost false rape accusation seemed to be made by/at the behest of parents (i.e. ""the only way our girl could have come home late was if she was raped"", though both teens being stupid and statutory rape are real things).\nDue to the attitudes of police and stuff, a rape accusation has a good chance of being thrown out or straight up ignored even if it\'s a legitimate one.\nThe chances of you getting actually arrested and then put in jail for false rape accusations are just astronomical. The real issue is that the court of public opinion is more emotional than factual, and that\'s an issue that goes both ways. Innocent men can be robbed of their livelihood because of one vindictive person, and actual victims can have people point and laugh about their trauma because ""she\'s just a slut"".\nIn my personal opinion, the #metoo movement has done more good than harm, especially since it\'s gotten a few abusers of males into the spotlight instead of just going ""pfft men getting raped funny joke doesn\'t really happen"". While their are those who leverage it unjustly to their benefit, those sorts of people were already around and would just find something else to take advantage of.\nNow to see if I can find that subreddit I mentioned, since it actually seemed nice.\nEdit: Found it, /r/MensLib , seems to be nice. I haven\'t really spent to much time on there, but it seems to be MRA but focused on being positive and avoiding hate.\n', 'Not to mention that much of the initial success of MeToo is closely related to male victims coming out and accusing their abusers.

If you are just trying to score with many women as possible, maybe you should consider whether you are the problem #metoo is addressing.\n\u200b\nFor the second problem, men that are falsely accused by #metoo activists are likely targets for other reasons. If the #metoo movement didn't exist, the people targeting them would find other popular ways of bringing them down, like tying them to bad political opinions or accusing them of racism.\n"", ""Your first argument is a valid one but I don't really agree. I am not a big fan of the hook-up culture but I don't think it's necessarily bad (Big difference between hook-up and rape/force btw). Just like marijuana I don't like it personally but I fully support the legalisation and usage of it because of a societal and personal benefit. This comes from my belief as well that hook ups isn't men wanting it, it's women wanting it as well. It is both parties job to make sure it's consensual and okay. Granted I would agree (although not what I'm arguing) that if you need to make sexual advances quickly that your relationship perhaps isn't long term. However, even there I think maybe men are afraid. Sure if you've been together forever you won't be afraid to make advances because you're past that stage. Instead if you're in a relationship and want to (as it would be natural to do) move it forward sexually many men are afraid of doing so, even in a good committed relationship. \n"", 'First of all, with regards to making moves, you\'re being super unclear about what you\'re referring to here. You seem to mostly be talking about not asking somebody out or doing any sort of clear signal they\'re attracted to somebody else, since you say that it\'s ""not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time"", which has basically nothing to do with #MeToo. So I don\'t really understand what the link is supposed to be here; are you saying that #MeToo has gotten guys so paranoid that they refuse to even ask people out? Because that\'s certainly not something I\'ve experienced, or even heard aside from the most absurd doomsayers.\nAs far as the false accusations thing, you\'re basically being mealy-mouthed to the point of having no view. ""Some people might possibly be harmed due to false claims in some way and maybe I read something about it but I\'m not sure"" is... not a lot to go on. I\'ll just say the generic bits: There is little reason to suspect that false claims about sexual assault are an epidemic problem or significantly more likely than any other sort of false claim. The number of people who either fear coming forward about their sexual assault due to doubt in the system, or do come forward but are mistreated by the system and fail to get justice, are so much greater than the number of malicious false accusations that it\'s silly to treat the (potential) falsely accused as more important than the (actual) victims.\n', 'I realise this now, and I apologise. However, I would argue that this applies to even semi-sexual encounters - suggestive touching, hugs, kisses, etc. I think perhaps asking out isn\'t the case, more suggestive things. I think to some extent even sexual things. Men are afraid of making sexual moves with people/partners they are more confident and comfortable with as well, in fear of being judged, accused, or attacked because of it. Still you made a good point about the #metoo movement not being about ""asking out"" and whatnot, and you\'re right. I just didn\'t make it clear - sorry on my behalf.\n\u200b\nI would definitely agree that the number of people afraid of coming forward is greater than those who are falsely accused, my point is that the metoo movement has created more false accusations and men are more worried than ever about false accusations, after a quick google search there are so many articles you can find from reliable and less reliable sources backing me up on this, from cases of false accusations to men being afraid of false accusations.\n\u200b\nExamples: https://morningconsult.com/2018/10/11/a-year-into-metoo-public-worried-about-false-allegations/\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/10/17957126/himtoo-movement-pieter-hanson-tweet-me-too\nThere are more and I know the above are more opinion posts than facts (although they have statistics) but this is just the top few articles, there are more if you research. \n\u200b\nUltimately you made a good point in saying that I wasn\'t clear but you haven\'t changed my mind.

Because that’s not something they should be doing. \nIf what you mean by “moves” is “touching someone sexually without knowing explicitly that they want me to”, you shouldn’t be making those moves.

Whilst I understand it, it is also kind of shunned upon to ask for a kiss or a hug (for example after a first date) from my own experience and as others have told me.

Maybe that means you lose out on sex with a girl so really wants to not have to explicitly consent, but if that’s the case you dodged a goddamned bullet.\n\nTrue I don\'t disagree - my point isn\'t ""oh it\'s weird to ask for consent to have sex for the first time"" - obviously it isn\'t and it\'s necessary but that\'s my point - men are afraid of less sexual encounters or encounters with that aren\'t the slightest bit sexually charged. The other day for example a woman in a convenience store called the police on a boy who apparently sexually grabbed her ass or touched her inappropriately lower down her back. What actually happened and CCTV footage showed this after an investigation - the young schoolboys backpack briefly rubbed against her back as he was walking past. Obviously this boy had no intentions of even an encounter with the woman.\n', ""Was her accusation false or did she really believe it happened and was proven wrong?\nDid her 'false accuasation' ruin that boy's life? Is he in jail or ostrasized or on some sex offender registry somewhere now because of it?\nOr was it a one-off situation where she accused in good faith, was proven wrong, and nothing horrible happened to the kid as a result?\n"", '\nFirst of all, with regards to making moves, you’re being super unclear about what you’re referring to here. \nWhat i believe he is referring to is women asking why don‘t they make sexual advances. (Yes i did read the rest of your comment so i know that you pointed out that he said it doesnt always mean sexually) but this is how i took it. Ive definitely been asked why i havent made any sexual moves and its mainly because I think of myself as a gentleman and its very scary that I could be accused of something with a negative intent and i of course never have any sort of negative intention when it comes to this.\n\n', ""I would say this is not at all incorrect but I would like to clarify the distinction between sexual (sex, sexual touching, grabbing, making very sexual remarks (if you are complimenting a girl you know on a physical attribute that isn't sexual I see no reason unless she asks you to stop for that to be considered wrong) and things like hugs, perhaps a kiss after a great first date, or even for example tapping someone on the shoulder to get their attention.\n"", 'Daviedou\n\nSure, it could be argued that this is good and I\'d agree if that only applied to men who otherwise had intended harm or who wouldn\'t have understood the idea of taking it too far or men who simply disregard consent.\n\nThis middle group is the largest. The ""well meaning but dumb as bricks"" group.\n\nNot only do I feel personally that global movements such (mainly) as #metoo have made not only myself, but other friends a lot more scared to make moves (not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time) a lot more afraid to do so, but I know that a lot of men and women too who believe this.\n\nI find this hard to believe. \n1) Serial womanizers don\'t care.\n2) Introverts generally don\'t date, period.\n3) Rapists don\'t care.\nThe only people who care are the ones that know that they\'re likely to commit sexual assault while drunk or ""in the heat of the moment"", and they\'re worried they\'re gonna get caught (as they should be).\n\nPlease change my view, like I said overall I believe in the idea of making subject matters like this more open and less taboo, but I think this movement in particular can and have made men afraid and can harm them.\n\nIt\'s very simple. If you have questions, ask them. \nIf you would like to go out a date would a lady, you simply say ""Hi, my name is blank! I saw you doing [blank], and I was wondering if I could get to know you a bit better! Can I buy you a coffee sometime?\nIt\'s basically like applying for a job interview.\nIf you\'re on a dating platform, you don\'t need to be so uptight, because presumably, it puts your interests in your profile and matches accordingly.\nIf you\'re not used to dating, you can simply go the pacifist route and go join things that have hobbies that you like and see if there\'s any people that strike your fancy, and then basically feel them out.\nYou can always ask people straight up, and remember to be courteous and say ""If you\'d rather not answer, that\'s fine too.""\nAnd if they don\'t want to hang around you, just excuse yourself and leave. Then go cry yourself to sleep or go grind in a video game or something.\nBeen there, done that.\nNote: I\'m a goddamn stereotypical programmer. ""Crushing pussy"" is not something I am familiar with.\n', 'Maybe they are, maybe they aren\'t - Neither of us have statistics to argue that. As I have mentioned in many replies it doesn\'t matter if they are the largest group because there are a large minority that are also affected who don\'t have bad intentions are are as you said ""well meaning but dumb as bricks"". \nSecond point is just wrong. Rapists don\'t care, womanizers don\'t and introverts don\'t date. That\'s true. But there are men who are genuinely just afraid of being called out by women who don\'t care. Obviously if you do something really horrible or take it way too far you are in the wrong, but many times men are called out for doing something much worse when they have done something otherwise pretty harmless or insignificant. An easy ""no"" or ""please stop"" is enough and the man should respect that. If they don\'t they\'re in the wrong but women have not even said ""no"" and gone straight to blaming them of something much more heinous. I think to make the claim that the only people who care are drunk assaulters is completely false. An article I read the other day said 57% (can\'t comment right now on the validity of this but I believe it was a reliable source) of US adults are worried about false allegations towards men as they are of women facing sexual assault - are you saying 57% of US adults are drunk rapists?\nWhilst I agree with the whole question/consent thing, I would argue it is also frowned upon by society to be the weird guy who asks the woman after a great date if he can kiss her. Sure some may approve of it, but in my own experience girls who are into you don\'t want you to constantly ask what I can do, they want some spontaneity too - this is where the balance becomes very hard and men become afraid of doing the wrong thing and being blamed for ""sexual assault"" or ""rape"". But other than that I would agree with how you see the situation.\nI don\'t like online dating but I\'d agree with your statement. Yet when you meet in person there is always the question of what is right and what could be interpreted as wrong or harassment.\nOverall I\'d say you seem very smart and have some good points but I don\'t really agree with the some things relating to my actual argument/discussion-point. And yes I\'ve been there too - at least video games don\'t reject you or call you out for sexual assault ;)\n', 'Men are 230 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than falsely accused.\nIt\'s literally SOOOO easy to not be accused of sexual assault. You literally ONLY have to NOT sexually assault people, communicate honestly with others, and respect boundaries. I believe that\'s just about it.\nAnyone who is afraid is either nervous because they know their past actions warrant assault, which, FUCK them because they\'re among the worst scum who KNOW the difference and have been hurting women/others because they thought they would never be accountable. But now people are coming forward and they\'re fucking freaking out. I WONDER WHY!\nAs far as you or anyone who is afraid to ""make moves,"" you literally just have to have open lines of communication. Things like discussing before hand or, say in the midst of kissing just asking ""do you want to go farther?"" or ""would you like me to.."" or ""can I..."" and then respecting the response is SO fucking easy. Even reading body language is easy as hell and I don\'t think I buy it when people say ""they don\'t know."" I feel like these are people whose bare minimum for respect begins and ends with vocal rejection which some people are too anxious to speak up about and while they detect their partner is nervous, without those explicit words, they\'ll continue and worsen the comfort level of their partner.\nThis literally is one of those ""if you\'re innocent, you\'re fine"" situations. If you are worried of being called out in a #metoo story, you\'re either guilty and you fucking know it, or you DESPERATELY need a crash course in how to not sexually assault someone, which is fucking insane to me and also kind of suggests you KNOW what red flag behaviors are but don\'t want to give them up because they\'re all you\'ve relied on to get any action. Which is, of course, fucking horrifying. \n', 'The article is a good read and a valid point... if it related to my discussion/argument. I\'m not arguing false accusations are higher statistically than sexual assault, only that false accusations is an issue that needs tackling, and that have grown due to the metoo movement. For example I read an article (pretty reliable if I remember correctly) that cited a statistic from this year I believe saying that 57% of US adults (men and women) are equally worried about false accusations of males as they are of sexual assault. Those 57% have to, to some extent be justified in their belief. No?\nWhilst I agree with the whole ""FUCK them"" as they are some of the worst scum of earth who I wish hell upon, I don\'t agree that they are the only ones that are afraid of it. Because of the metoo movement other men have become afraid of any actions that are even semi-sexual in nature (hugging, suggestive touching (not sexual touching but maybe frequent touching for example), even kissing maybe (like first date to kiss or not to kiss situation), etc). There was even a case of a woman calling the police on a boy who ""touched her inappropriately"" (was really just a nudge on her lower back) only to later see on the cctv camera that it was his school bag (he was really young) that briefly bumped into her. It is situations like this that make people afraid of even the most mundane sexual or romantic actions or encounters.\nI can say from experience that communication is key, but I also know from experience and others that the majority of girls want some spontaneity. Like I mentioned before it is usually frowned upon if you were to for example ask if you could kiss a girl after a good first date, you either do it or don\'t. Still I agree that communication is key. Anyone who doesn\'t respect the response are genuine scum assholes who deserve hell, that doesn\'t mean that there aren\'t men who are respectful who doesn\'t get screwed over. Saying body language is easy might be easy for you to say. I think personally as well I am good at reading body language and I have been successful for the most part in my sexual or romantic/relationship endeavours but it is unfair to assume everyone is. Sure if someone is clearly uncomfortable, ignoring that is wrong, but it isn\'t always clear and it isn\'t always with partners who you have spent long periods of time with either, it could for example be first encounter (obviously sexual situations shouldn\'t occur at this time), or first dates or even after a few dates.\nIt\'s not one of those situations of ""if you\'re innocent you won\'t be blamed"" as many many men have faced false allegations with more and more becoming common and being spoken out about.\nI wouldn\'t say either of those are true, I have never gone too far and made someone uncomfortable, quite the opposite I\'ve been told to be more spontaneous and less worried about my actions (asking less if things are okay) and I don\'t either think it\'s fair to say I\'ve ignored red flags to get action. I despise rapists, sexual assaulters or people with no respect for others as much as you do.\nI think it\'s fair you have your opinion, and even if I disagree you have a right to your opinion, although your last paragraph was a little aggressive and accusatory and I didn\'t appreciate that.\n', 'Have you ever tried asking to kiss someone?  It’s the most effective “line” I’ve ever used.\n', 'Actually I have - although I ended up kissing them both times one of them initially had a bad reaction and the other paused for a moment before saying ""yes? I guess"". But hey - if it works wonders for you then props to you. I guess it depends on the girl.\n', 'I believe that, what you\'ve said here, is absolutely why some are scared about receiving an accusation of sexual assault or rape. \nYou\'ve made it clear that you believe that a woman making an accusation is only ever going to do so against a man who is definitely guilty of it. The man is either a rapist or a dummy who refuses to understand consent. \nNobody is defending rape, sexual assault, negating consent, or even push back against aggressive men. People are worried that a perfectly normal relationship will explode, because the woman has realized she has something to gain by accusing them. And there are several very infamous cases where this was exactly the case. ""Mattress Girl"" being one. \nIt would be less of an issue if accusations were made, it was investigated, guilt/innocence concluded in a trial, and everyone went on their way. But that\'s not how it works. The court of public opinions judges someone guilty immediately on an accusation being announced. The accused suffers drastic penalties, both in their career/education and socially, and if/when it eventually comes out they were innocent, the accuser suffers no consequences of their act. \nNow, I don\'t believe this is some kind of epidemic. I dont think men need to be afraid of the ""False Accusation Boogeyman"", they just need to be more selective in the women they get close to. However, insisting that women cannot make false accusations (and thus all accused are guilty) is very naive and unhealthy. \n', 'I would 100% agree and I\'m not personally afraid of the ""false accusation boogeyman"" myself but I think it\'s still an issue that the metoo movement have made a little easier to pull off and some men have become a little scared of it.\n', 'I certainly understand people being concerned. With the presumption that ""accusation = guilt"" and how institutions will eject you based on that (or for fear of public outcry if they dont), a person can be branded with a scarlet letter and have their life destroyed over something they didn\'t do and were never even tried for. \nIt certainly helps nothing that its near impossible to even talk about it, with the modern political climate as it is. You can see in my comment chain that even a moderate ""everyone gets the benefit of the doubt"" is considered unreasonable. No, people want to reverse the Blackstone Formulation of """"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer"", into something where it doesn\'t matter how many innocents are punished, so long as some are found guilty. \nThat all said;\nIn most cases that I\'m aware of, the motivation for a false accusation was either over a power struggle or a toxic relationship. So I don\'t think the average guy needs to worry about talking to women or trying to flirt respectfully.\nGenerally, I don\'t think the majority of women are the type to ever do such a thing anyways. More, I would advise people to be wary of those who are ... political extremists... and have bought into the hysteria. A woman might happily accept you buying her a drink at a bar, but someone across the room can accuse you of putting something in it, for example. \n', ""I'm a woman who's a victim of sexual abuse and while I do agree a bit with your point on how simple it is to not sexually assault people, I think we also have to factor in OPs point. \nHe's talking about false accusations and they may sound unbelievable but they can happen. I knew of some people in therapy who opened up that they were there because they were falsely accused and they were traumatized by how people joined in arms and treated them like shit for something he did not do. The problem really is just like sexual abuse/assault with women, false accusations are not really talked about that much because people will most likely not believe you. And my whole point with this is that we cannot dismiss the idea of people getting falsely accused just because we think they cannot exist. They also need our support because it's a difficult situation too because once you've been branded as one (sexual assault) even if proven wrong it will always stick with people. And just imagine having your life ruined over something false. That's definitely saddening and is disconcerting. \n"", 'Firstly I want to say how sorry I am that you had to have gone through something so horrible - I hope you had people who could help you through it and I hope you never ever have to go through something like that ever again.\nSecondly I want to thank you for corroborating my point and for honestly clarifying it a bit.

Another thing to point out is that even if 1 in 4 women are raped, that doesn't make 1 in 4 men rapists. Even then that wasn't my point. The point is that women are feeling more confident falsely accusing men because of the movement and more false accusations are coming out because of it.\nThat second argument is flawed too. If they were sexually assaulted or raped that is very very unfortunate and I wish hell on the rapist or the one who commits the assault, this doesn't mean innocents should be put in the crossfire in an attempt to charge others who are guilty. Yes women should be comfortable reporting and coming forward about rapists but not encouraged or otherwise feel safe by a movement to falsely accuse men.\nI would argue that this applies to even semi-sexual encounters - suggestive touching, hugs, kisses, etc. You'd be right in pointing out that I wasn't specific.

That whole “I’d rather let ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison” thing.\n', 'Regarding the fear of making moves: \nPretty much anytime a woman goes anywhere or does anything, she is expected to take precautions against being assaulted. Decisions like where to park, where to live, what to wear, whether we can take a walk at a specific time or place...it is expected and largely accepted that this is apart of being a woman. This is especially true when it comes to dating. While you and your friends may be cautious to ""make moves"", any woman who might be interested is calculating whether or not you seem safe enough to go on a date or be alone with. While you might fear that your well-meaning actions may be misinterpreted, women fear that you may injure, rape, or even kill them. With all this in mind, it doesn\'t seem particularly onerous to me that men may now fear ""making moves"" more than they did before. \nWith that said, I personally think it is a good thing that well-meaning men are thinking before they act and getting a new perspective on how some of their actions may be perceived by women. There are plenty of socially acceptable situations that are uncomfortable, intrusive, and even coercive towards the women involved, and the only way to avoid this is clear and open communication. I think anyone--including well-meaning men who genuinely do not want to hurt women--should consider this cultural shift a plus. \nAs for the issue of false accusations, many people have already mentioned that these are incredibly rare so I won\'t belabor the point. But even if they were more prevalent, IMO the answer to this problem is the old internet adage: don\'t stick your dick in crazy. Whether you\'re just hooking up or looking for something more long-term, its simply a matter of looking out for yourself, and if you\'re not doing it already, you should start immediately. Even before any fear of false accusations, there have always been crazy exes and jilted lovers doing crazy shit. \nComing forward with a rape accusation is an earth-shattering, life-altering thing. Getting the law involved costs money, and in the case of a false accusation runs the risk of perjury. The level of crazy involved in bringing a patently false accusation is several orders of magnitude higher than say, stealing your wallet after you fall asleep, trying to fuck your best friend, attacking you, or throwing all your shit out on the lawn--all things you should be trying to avoid in a potential partner or hookup anyway. So, in my opinion, anyone who is looking out for themselves the way they should be isn\'t all that likely to get involved with someone who is going to falsely accuse them. I think it also bears repeating here, that on the flipside, women are evaluating dates and hookups based on how likely they seem to rape, maim, or kill us. So it is hard for me to sympathize with the idea that it\'s this big, onerous thing that men suddenly feel the need to exercise good judgement about the kind of people they are canoodling with. \nEdit: added paragraph breaks\n', 'Nothing has changed regarding the law, and nothing has changed regarding what people view as right/wrong.\n', 'No, but the culture has changed for better and worse.

It can be possible that the #metoo movement both greatly reduces the prevalence of sexual assault and sometimes makes men afraid to make a move. If this is the case, the one can judge the movement based on the relative harm of each.

Who is harmed more: women who are assaulted or men who are afraid to make a move?\n\u200b\nAs a side, if this whole thing has prompted conversation between men and women like the one you described (where the women are asking ""why didn\'t you make a move - I wanted you to"") I\'d argue that is a huge plus.
