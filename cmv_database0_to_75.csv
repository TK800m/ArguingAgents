0,Admira1Jackbar,"There are two components to my argument. First, I believe that releasing the results, in the manner that she did, will strategically/politically hurt her chances in 2020.Second, I believe the way in which she has sold her Native American ancestry is morally wrong.How should Warren have proceeded? I believe that she could have publicized her results without coming off as offensive and culturally incompetent. She could have used the video to honestly explain that her family had hyperbolized her Native American roots, that she does not identify as Native American, and that she has not been oppressed in any way because of her ancestry. This has been a rambling post, but I think ya'll get my major points.​Edit#1: Thank you so much all for engaging in this conversation. I have tried to respond to as many posts as I can but unfortunately have to get back to studying. My perspective is largely unchanged but I will continue trying to respond when I can. Furthermore, there has been some misinformation about the DNA test results and how they are interpreted. One user linked me this article, which has a great breakdown of what the test means. In summary, it is much more likely that Warren is 1/64th native American as opposed to 1/500th or 1/1,000 Native American. This doesn't really change my main points, but it is good to get the facts straight.​Edit#2: This boston globe article has a good summary of the situation at hand. A lot of people are saying that she has never identified as Native American, but that is contradictory to this relevant passage: ""In an interview with the Globe published last month, Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many of the matriarchs of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories and history were becoming lost. Ivy League universities, like the ones where Warren taught, were under great pressure to show they had diverse staffs.The University of Pennsylvania filled out a document explaining why it hired a white woman over minority candidates — clear evidence it didn’t view her as a Native American addition. And the Globe interviewed 31 Harvard Law School faculty members who voted on her appointment there, and all said her heritage was not a factor.""So, while I don't think it's likely that her career has been significantly furthered by claims to Native American heritage, the fact is that she has identified as Native American historically. I believe that she should have addressed this in her video and been explicit that it was a mistake to ever identify as Native American. Also, before you comment, I would strongly recommend reading the two articles I have linked as they provide most of the information you need to know.

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\'t generally go down well in MA. \nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\'s consider that she\'s got no 2020 plans.\nIf her seat is safe and she\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\'re beating on ""Pocahontas"" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MS), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \nSo Warren\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \nThat\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway. It makes more sense if she doesn\'t plan on running. \n', ""Hmm. Interesting take. I guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing. While I stand by my statement my moral objections to the way she went about this, I think that if indeed she isn't going to run in 2020 this strategy makes more sense. \n"", ""\nI guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing.\n\nI'm not sure how you'd go about a conditional delta, but if they made you see things from a different light, consider awarding an actual delta. Delta doesn't mean compete transversal and you don't have to wait around until 2020 and be 100% convinced to give it.\n"", 'Just add !\\delta (without the slash), to the previous comment.\n', 'My bad never posted here before\n', ""I guess the moral component would depend on how successful the strategy is. If she can distract enough GOP hate to somehow help the Democrats win all of their competitive races and get back a Senate majority, she would have played a part in making sure that no more Kavanaughs happen between now and 2020. \nIf you see that as a good thing (as she surely does), then you could argue that she's doing a morally questionable action for the sake of a larger moral victory. In the end, the extent of damage she does here is frustrating a percentage of the Native American community for a few months. If the strategy works and the Dems take the Senate, there's the potential to prevent things that are way more damaging than that. So you could argue that going for the strategy would be a moral good. . . in aggregate (if not in isolation). \n"", ""Sure - I hereby award one !delta for giving me a new perspective. If it is the case that she is not going through with a 2020 bid, I believe that this might help other democrats in their respective campaigns by eating up news realestate that would otherwise be focused on them. Since Warren's seat is probably safe, the negative attention on her doesn't really matter for her personal political strategy. However, I don't believe that this was her strategy intentionally, rather, I believe this might be one positive consequence of an overall poor decision. I think it's more likely that Warren went through with this whole thing to advance her personal agenda rather than as some altruistic distraction. Furthermore, you mentioned the ND race - I think that's where this whole thing might be the most detrimental. If Native Americans votes are swayed by this whole thing or their enthusiasm is at all reduced, it hurts Heitkamp's chances.\n"", 'I think the main strategic advantage of Warren’s decision is that it disarms one of Trump’s primary avenues of attack, name calling. Pocahontas has been Trump’s go to name for Warren for quite a while. If Warren brings up the million dollar donation every time Trump says Pocahontas she either galvanized her base by continuing to point out that Trump is a hypocrite or pushes Trump away from using that name. Either possibility is beneficial. \n', ""Hmm.. I don't think Trump will stop using Pocahantas. I think he and his supporters will persist b/c in their eyes Warren is no more Native American than she was prior to the DNA results. Furthermore, the bet was that Trump would pay if the DNA showed she was 'an Indian'. Since you can't prove that with a DNA test as it is mostly a cultural/experiential identity, there is no way to win or lose the bet. Warren has legitimized the ridiculous bet by engaging with it and bending to Trump's requests. \n"", 'The issue is that you’re looking too far ahead.\nThe big hurdle for Warren to be president is getting on the ballot by winning the Democrat primary. \nHaving the Trump base attack her, while simultaneously adding some validity to her ancestry claim gives her some credit in the eyes of Dems as someone the right hates and protects her from attacks within her own party. You’re not going to convince Trump supporters that she’s an Indian, but you might trick one of her primary challengers to fall for the bait of contesting her claim. If a Dem starts arguing that she can’t be Indian because she doesn’t have enough ‘blood’, the identity politics wing of the party will cannibalize them.\nDefeating Trump is a matter of a lot of factors out of her control and more about how the Dems vs Reps mobilize and how current events and news sway voters. The primary is much more about her individually and where she needs to focus her efforts. This does that.\n', ""Hmmm I'm not sure I follow your argument. So you think that this whole thing will benefit her in the primaries b/c a  another democrat might bring up the illegitimacy of her claims? I honestly don't see any democrat trying to touch this issue in a debate (the damage has been done and they wouldn't want to give her anymore room to soften the issue) and based off how left wing media is covering this I don't think it has won her many points with liberals. Perhaps the increased criticism from right wing media will drum up tribal support from democrats as passion begets passion, but I still think the net result will be negative. \n"", 'Trump’s exact quote doesn’t ask her to prove tribal membership, but specifically mentions a DNA test\n“We will take that little [DNA] kit, but we have to do it gently. Because we’re in the #MeToo generation so we have to be very gentle. And we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t injure her arm even though it only weighs probably two ounces. And we will say: I will give you a million dollars, paid for by Trump, to your favorite charity, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian.”\n', ""Yes... and she wins the bet if the DNA test 'shows you're an Indian'. Since we have established that there is no definition of what would qualify as Indian, it is an impossible bet to win or lose. Different tribes have different metrics. It can show that she has a Native American in her ancestry, but that's not what Trump said. \n"", 'Thats such a bs excuse. Especialy since hes said other times that he thinks she has less native ancestry then him, and he has none. \nIf the same people that are ""pissed off"" at Warren kept Trump to the same standard he wouldn\'t have made it out of the primary. \n', ""But I'm not comparing Warren vs. Trump, I'm comparing Warren vs. every other 2020 hopeful. I believe that this whole thing has been a strategic blunder and is not the correct way to engage with Trump. This whole thing has made me less sure that Warren would do well 1v1 with Trump. \n"", 'If you step back just a bit.   Warren liability is the Pocahontas’s thing,  Trumps liabilities dwarf hers.     It’s amazing this is presented as a debate of two equivalent candidates. \n', ""I agree it's ridiculous, but that doesn't change the fact that it's important and I think Warren could have handled it way better. \n"", ""You can prove you are Native American by DNA, if your percentage is high enough. You are indigenous to the US if you predominantly descend from the original inhabitants of the US. You can't be Native American solely by culture. Of course, this means Warren is not indigenous and just has some minute indigenous ancestry.\n"", ""I should clarify - I acknowledge that the DNA test is good at showing what percent of your DNA is from Native American ancestors. However, there is no solid definition for whether or not someone is Native American. Short of being 100% genetically Native American, there are many different metrics used by various tribes to determine if someone qualifies. So what metric would be used in this bet? How could Warren win the bet? She can't b/c it's a nonsense bet made with no qualifications and whoever wins is completely arbitrary. \n"", 'She herself clearly stated, she has native ancestry, but does not belong to any tribe and does not claim to have any status with any tribe. \nIt\'s only being brought up by conservatives as an attack because they have nothing else on her, but she is now bringing it up because it has been a perfect demonstration of how Trump lies and contradicts himself: years of calling her out on it and demanding a DNA test, offering a million dollars only to say ""who cares?"" and ""I never said that, read it again"" with numerous videos of the contrary. It further chips away at his credibility with those not an unwavering supporter.\nFor someone who claims to be so wealthy to refuse to give (a ""small loan"" worth) to a CHARITY does not shine a good light on his character.  \n', 'The point is that Trump calling her ""Pocahontas"" was a jab that assumed she was lying about her Native American ancestry for some sort of gain (although there is pretty decent reporting showing that Warren did not gain benefits from telling the truth on forms from the 80s that she had Native American ancestors).\nIt isn\'t exactly important how large a percentage of Native American Warren is, because the argument was never what percentage Native American is Warren. The question, as posed by Republicans including Trump, was whether or not Warren could realistically claim to have had Native American ancestors. According to the DNA results, she can.\nMany people are now trying to shift the argument to be about the question about what percentage of Native American you have to be to claim to be Native, but that isn\'t correct at all. Calling someone Pocahontas because it has racial overtones and almost sounds demeaning isn\'t something to back down from. And even if the argument the whole time was that Warren doesn\'t have enough recent Native American ancestors, isn\'t that accusations enough by itself when coming from the POTUS to rise up and defend your heritage and family history? Why should any individual in this country be ashamed of their great great grandparents or their great great great grandparents just because of their ethnicity?\nThose are a lot of words, but it is so wrong that any individual should feel ashamed for not burying their past. It isn\'t that Warren actively promoted herself (although others ran a little wild) as a Native American, so shouldn\'t we all be at least a little disgusted that anyone would attack her for just her acknowledgement that one of her distant ancestors fell in love with a Native American?\n', 'You’re probably right about Trump sticking to Pocahontas. And you’re probably right that engaging with this bet legitimizes Trump’s words. But Trump is the president. His words have some inherent legitimacy or at least significance. If Warren can make people remember those words as a failed promise she made a sound choice.\nI don’t think the minutia of Trump’s statement matters too much. Warren took a DNA test that validated the story she has been saying about her ancestry, the same story Donald Trump makes fun of. That won’t mean much to Trump supporters, but to people actually on the fence or Warren’s supporters it means She has been telling an accurate truth for years, which does seem meaningful.\nIf Warren does decide to go for a Presidential run in 2020 I think the tactic of making Trump eat his words could serve her well. This seems like a first step in that kind of strategy. \n', ""I'm have no level of respect for Trump, but the donation was based on proof of being Native American. A maximum of 1/64 Native American ancestry is not being a Native American anymore than I am French due to my mother's great great great great great grandfather being from France. The last one of my ancestors who considered themselves French died before the War of 1812.\nElizabeth Warren is not Native American, she has no tribal connections, no cultural connections and no blood connections within the last century. Trump is very, very rarely justified in his actions but if I had made the bet I wouldn't pay out either.\n"", ""> It gives the right a ton of ammo for attack adds and talking points. They can now say that Warren has benefited from her claim of Native American heritage while being scarcely Native American\nWe're weeks into this thing and no one has shown that Harvard even has an affirmative action plan for Native Americans. In fact, all I can find on AA is that they lower test score requirements for students from poor, rural and sparsely populated areas.\n"", ""I'm not making an assertion that she benefited from her claims to Native American history - that's actually irrelevant to my argument. I think it is pretty clear, however, that this whole thing has made it easier for right wing pundits to say that she has benefited. In the past, she has identified as Native American on applications (one or more times, i'm not sure and it doesn't matter). Thus, she has identified as Native American while having no real cultural or genetic basis for doing so. This is very easily spun by pundits - if you don't believe me, go to Breitbart of Fox News or Ben Shapiro's channel right now. \n"", ""\nIn the past, she has identified as Native American on applications (one or more times, i'm not sure and it doesn't matter)\n\nIt does matter, and the number is zero applications.\nWhy does it matter? Because it makes your concern about right-wing spin irrelevant, and even better, the spin becomes obvious trolling.

And yea - I guess she would be crucified by right wing media no matter what, but the fact there is some truth to this (not that she benefited, but that she had identified as a minority before when she isn\'t) means it will gain more traction and land more heavily, espicially when such media reaches undecided voters. \n', ""I'm conservative, and African American.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a pretty minor issue. There's no evidence she tried to use this status to her financial benefit, to help her career, or that she identified as Native American in any other situation. Her colleagues and superiors say they knew her as a white woman. She never tried to obtain tribal citizenship or identify with any tribal nation in a legal sense.\nShe claims she did it in hopes that she might connect with other people of Native American descent, since she knew it was part of her family history and wanted to learn more. You can believe her or not, but again there's nothing to suggest she used this to advance her career.\nAs someone with experience in genetic genealogy, I would say her DNA results do in fact validate her Native American heritage. The report shows she very likely had a Native American ancestor 6-10 generations back. You might be thinking that's pretty far removed, but hear me out.\nWhen this whole thing popped up during Warren's senate campaign, she talked about how her family always told her they were part Native American. Genealogists started digging and discovered that Warren's great great great grandmother was allegedly Native American (her name was O.C. Sarah Smith). There was no solid proof, but it seems to be a common claim passed down among this woman's descendants. If this ancestor was full blooded, that would make Warren 1/32nd Native American. However, genealogists seem to agree that she wasn't full blooded. If this ancestor was half Native American, that would make Warren 1/64th Native American, which would mean Warren is 6 generations removed from a full blooded Native American ancestor. This fits with the DNA test, so it's totally plausible this ancestor (Warren's 3x great grandmother) was half Native American.\nA great great great grandmother is not as far removed as you might think. One of my great great grandmothers was still alive when I was born - I even have a picture of her holding me as a baby! I know all about this side of the family, because she lived so long. This is only one generation less than Warren's supposed Native American ancestor, so it's not unrealistic at all that the family might still be well aware of their heritage, and consider it to be a significant part of their identity. There would be physical traits, stories passed down, names... all of it eventually dwindling away generation by generation, but they still held onto the identity. If they openly shared this fact, it's not hard to imagine some unfavorable opinions when Warren's parents married in 1932.\nJust like many Native Americans who assimilated into European-American society, Warren's ancestors left no paper trail. If they didn't want to to be persecuted or discriminated against, they would do anything they could to fit in without a trace. It wasn't until relatively recently that it became acceptable or desirable to claim Native American ancestry. There are tons of families just like Warren's, who don't have it documented, but know through oral tradition. You can put all kinds of political spin on it, but it's hard to deny there's something amazing about DNA backing up oral family history from at least 6 generations ago, and that's the main thing I take away from this whole issue.\nIt's true that Warren is mostly of European descent, but at no point did Warren lie about this. Nothing she said has been proven wrong or even misleading... if anything, it's all been reinforced by DNA evidence.\nOn the other hand, strategically I would agree with you. Republicans don't care about facts or science. They will build their own narrative, and Warren is just fanning the flames by responding at all. Democrats aren't going to win by arguing with idiots. They win by talking passionately about important issues, and presenting a better vision for the future.\n"", ""Yup, I've come around to the conclusion that Warren hasn't benefited from or exaggerated her claims of Native American ancestry.

So I didn\'t try to draw correlation there. I\'m saying that she both is <1% NA and she hasn\'t had tribal involvement. \nIn terms of why this strikes me as immoral, I had two points. First, she is overplaying minority status for personal gain. When she chose to identify as Native American in the 80\'s, she knew that, at most, her great great great grandmother was Native American. Now, with the release of this video, she is overplaying her Native American roots and making a huge scene out of having 1/64th Native American DNA max. To me, that is capitalizing on minority status that isn\'t there and hasn\'t tangibly affected her. That is immoral. Second, by not having more conversations with Native Americans when making this video, she has unduly offended many Native Americans. Is it immoral to unduly offend an oppressed minority? I tend to believe so. \n', 'Sure, but that doesn’t refute my point. That’s a relative argument. \n', 'I think you\'re assuming that there\'s the nothing option, the test option, and then another better option?\nI don\'t think that doing nothing is a good choice. Lots of democrats have tried to rise above the petty bickering, even some more moderate republicans in the last presidential primary tried. Where did it get them? No where, they lost because to some decent percentage of American voters any claim needs to be answered. Any unanswered claim seems like an admission of guilt. Are those voters uninformed idiots? Maybe, but the strategy of ""just make up bullshit and force the other person to refute it"" seems to have been working for the last couple election cycles (at least). So ""nothing"" isn\'t an option.\nTaking a test and proving that there\'s truth to her story at least takes the idea that she\'s just lying off the table. That\'s essentially been the claim coming from the right, and her counter claim, as far as I can tell has been:\n\nMy family always said that there was native american ancestory on my mother\'s side\nIt was such an issue that she said back in 2012 her father\'s family wasn\'t going to let him marry her mom, and they had to elope. And apparently it continued to be an issue her entire life because it also caused some problem at her mother\'s funeral. \nShe never claimed to be part of a tribe or ever claimed any kind of cultural heritage\nShe really hasn\'t mentioned it much at all in her entire career, and the only reason it\'s an issue at all is that republicans went looking for dirt from her past, and this is the best that they could come up.\n\nSo, I\'m not sure what a better option would be? Let the other party continue to mock her, call her a lie, make up shit about her without responding at all? Try to give a civil answer? Because that\'s what she was doing for the last 4 years.\nWhat\'s a better option than just definitively settling the truth, she\'s has a tiny bit of native american ancestry, which is basically what she\'s been saying the whole time. If someone wants to go put in the effort to disprove her claim that her parents eloped, then that would be real news. Because otherwise I can\'t see how she\'s done anything even remotely wrong.\n', ""I don't think the 'nothing' option would have been all that bad and I actually think it would have been better than what she ended up doing. By doing nothing, the issue would have gotten, overall, less attention in independent and liberal circles and would have remained more isolated in Republican circles. However, I think 'nothing' was a second best option. What would be a better option? She could have come right out and acknowledged that the extent of her Native American ties was overplayed in family lore. She could have consulted with tribal leaders and people more knowledgable in this topic in order to publish her results in a way that didn't feel so tone deaf. While she never says she belongs to a tribe, she does say she has Native American heritage. While this is true, it feels very uncomfortable to make that claim without a large asterisk every time noting that it is a very distant heritage. She has also checked boxes (one box?) in her college applications identifying as Native American - she should have acknowledged that this was wrong and then emphasized that at no other time past that point in her professional career did she capitalize on this identity (which she did in her video, but without acknowledging that she had identified as Native American when she shouldn't have). \n"", ""\nIn her release video, she claims that the DNA results validate her Native American heritage.

I can't find any instance of her making this claim. I think that sometimes she may have abbreviated the term, but she never claimed to be Native American any more than by heritage.

Scott Brown, as you may remember, was a major player in the original iteration of this whole controversy some eight years ago during Warren\'s original run for US Senate against Brown.\nFinally, I want to challenge the notion that she has ""...never suffered any oppression that actual Native Americans suffer.""\nFirst, she is an actual Native American, both in terms of family lore (not under question), and now due to result of her genetic background. That she is not registered with a tribe is a separate issue from her self-identifying as having Native ancestry.\nSecond, her lived experiences and her family stories have shown that she was brought up in a lower middle-class upbringing, and that she did indeed face hardships as a teenager. A further point is that, whatever your opinion of it, affirmative action is not just meant to help a person out because of their direct struggles--it is also meant as a means to rectify generations of past disadvantages suffered by one\'s whole family. It can take generations for a family to come out of poverty, for example, and to the extent this issue (or similar issues) faced Warren\'s family, then even if she had used her Native ancestry for political gain (which I do not think she did, but that\'s a separate question), then that still may have been appropriate\n', ""Multiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered Native Americans and her parents told her they eloped because her paternal side of the family did not like that her mom was part Cherokee/Delaware. That sort of thing does impact how you form your own identity and affect how you view race.\nThere hasn't been a single colleague of hers that has come forward and said she was hired because of affirmative action. \nNative Americans groups have been on every side of the issue because they agree it's also hard to verify native ancestry by the paper trail as well , but don't want members of their tribe kicked out over DNA tests which Elizabeth Warren has said she is against.\n"", ""\nMultiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered Native Americans\n\n\u200b\nDo you have a cite for that? Because I've never seen that claim anywhere. From my own reading, her claim was to a single ancestor several generations back.\n"", ""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/08/brown-continues-offense-on-warren-over-native-american-claims/\n\nThe New England Historic Genealogical Society provided CNN with initial research last week, showing several members of Warren’s maternal family claiming Cherokee heritage. The Native American link extends to Warren’s great-great-great grandmother O.C. Sarah Smith, who is said to be described as Cherokee in an 1894 marriage license application. NEHGS gathered that information through a 2006 family newsletter, and says the original application cannot be located.\n\nYou can't just have one ancestor 5 generations back be native American that would make all of her ancestors on that side native american.\n"", ""Warren was totally honest and forthright. She didn't hide the numbers and released them. The people who are upset about that issue are basically saying she should be more Native American than she was. Does that in fact make her a liar? And how the hell can this reasoning only apply to Warren but not to the countless lies Trump told about his own background?\n"", 'It was strategically stupid. I am not sure what game the Dems are playing but they seem incompetent at this point. Letting Hillary continue to talk is equally as incompetent.

It is fallacious to make the claim that she is stooping to their level when Republicans won\'t even rise up and have some courtesy and decency as statesmen.\nNo, what Elizabeth Warren did was fine. If you should have any issues you should be upset at Mitch McConnell.     \n\nMcConnell said it would be ""very difficult to do entitlement reform, and we’re talking about Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid,"" with one party in charge of Congress and the White House.

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\'t generally go down well in MA. \nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\'s consider that she\'s got no 2020 plans.\nIf her seat is safe and she\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\'re beating on ""Pocahontas"" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MS), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \nSo Warren\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \nThat\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway. It makes more sense if she doesn\'t plan on running. \n']",58.21,"[[68.26, 70.02, 71.99, 76.56, 69.79, 73.85, 66.37, 60.04, 52.39, 69.72, 66.78, 59.16, 71.18, 72.87, 79.9, 86.3, 27.79, 73.51, 65.93, 56.25, 59.98, 49.99, 72.56, 57.81, 61.7, 49.15, 61.77, 50.5, 83.25, 49.35, 62.78, 72.46, 83.15, 67.59, 79.6, 56.96, 88.84, 43.06, 78.96, 63.36, 85.59, 81.29, 75.5, 64.54, 56.89, 59.8, 59.33, 51.18, 64.04, 36.8, 78.59, 57.61, 54.56, 69.75, 51.55, 69.11, 59.16, 61.7, 51.92, 51.85, 83.49, 83.15, 54.56, 80.62, 77.23, -63.05, 53.37, 58.28, 85.08, 86.71, 84.17, 43.93, 80.96, 86.54, 59.06, 76.93, 79.77, 64.04, 67.08, 87.72, 66.4, 48.47, 54.26, 68.26, 56.42, 68.26, 75.03, 65.73, 58.32, 76.22, 80.51, 78.59, 55.24, 75.54, 62.51, 91.41, 61.46, 53.51, 24.45, 77.57, 84.47, 57.61, 74.53, 76.62, 71.44, 74.79, 46.98, 51.38, 42.72, 95.17, 67.42, 81.33, 60.85, 52.19, 54.56, 74.69, 66.37, 57.23, 69.92, 83.49, 61.83, 52.73, 58.11, 52.73, 95.17, 32.9, 78.79, 66.98, 81.63, 92.12, 56.93, 62.38, 37.64, 64.81, 66.33, 69.31, 48.47, 73.58, 65.32, 31.56, 78.89, 75.91, 71.24, 96.99, 66.84, 42.04, 61.67, 95.17, 62.34, 65.01, 53.68, 80.62, 81.02, 70.02, 64.0, 64.61, 60.35, 64.2, 65.89, 68.2, 57.2, 58.52, 39.03, 50.5, 52.09, 60.65, 67.76, 57.3, 54.22, 72.76, 51.18, 55.58, 53.85, 41.36, 45.16, 82.04, 76.25, 82.34, 76.25, 61.67, 38.99, 36.96, 23.94, 64.75, 55.07, 57.44, 57.27, 19.16, 75.2, 70.19, 60.14, 90.16]]"
1,DuvetShmuvet,"Lately (over the few recent years) I've been hearing talk about how one of the most likely doomsday scenarios for the human race will by a super-intelligent AI.
I like Elon Musk, but I think he's way wrong on this. In my opinion, there is little to no danger of an AI being the cause of humanity's extinction or near-extinction.Here is my reasoning: in order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings. Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes. Theoretically, this weapon would have super-human intelligence but otherwise be incorporeal (using the computing resources of the world's computers as its brain). Let's assume that it does ""escape the lab"" or ""go rogue"" and for some reason decides that it wants to do as much damage to humanity as possible (why would it? Presumably that would be against its programming after all). What can this AI do? Well, let's assume, since it is super-intelligent, it can get into 100% of the world's internet-connected computer systems. The internet becomes one huge botnet. What next?Exactly...what next? Most modern military weaponry isn't remotely controlled, let alone internet-connected, and implementing these features in modern weaponry with the exception of drones (of which there is a very small amount compared to the rest of the military) would be undesirable, so it won't happen.Any rogue remotely controlled drones/devices would be put down with ease by the existing human military.So what else can the AI do? Disrupt infrastructure. Yes, except only developed countries have a significant amount of their infrastructure on internet-connected devices. Most of the world would have no problem either switching back to traditional paper-based systems or just carrying on using them because they never were fully computerized.The amount of infrastructure, globally, that would be affected would be pretty small and even though not easily rectifiable, it would cause negligible harm to the human race as a whole.Lastly: IF the AI took over everything, IF it was kill or be killed - all the humans need to do is snip the cables and shut off the power. The AI is incorporeal, it can't stop a mammal with wire cutters, or a physical switch in a power station.Humanity would prevail. Even in the absolute worst case scenario where it could theoretically kill off the human race (though I believe this scenario to be impossible for the reasons above) the humans would just kill it first.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes.\n\nThis is not the main concern. The threat is in the recursive self-improvement. If the AI is improving itself and decides its goal is to destroy humans, why would it make some silly mistake in execution of its plan? I don\'t know if you are familiar with the Deep Mind AI projects, but their Go program beat the world champion a couple years back. Its ability to play is a ""black box"". No one in the world understands how it plays Go, it just does. That computer program has more Go knowledge than the entire human race. It is possible that a general super intelligence could develop a way to fight us that we have not conceived. Isn\'t it almost by definition that a super-intelligence will be able to think of things that we haven\'t?\n', ""\nWhy would it make some silly mistake\n\nVery intelligent does not mean infallible. It could be near-perfect in its judgement, but it will never be omniscient. It would definitely be capable of making mistakes.\n\nIt is possible that a general super intelligence could develop a way to fight us that we have not conceived\n\nThis is true, but it is also true in any human-human conflict. There is always the possibility that our opponent will outsmart us. In my opinion, the collective intelligence of human beings is such that we would be able to counteract the AI.\nFor example, the Go program (thank you, I was not familiar with it): nobody might understand how it plays Go, currently. How many people are actively researching its method? I would wager not too many. I think, should humanity decide that playing Go optimally is crucial to the advancement or survival of our species, the resources poured into studying methods of playing Go and the methods of the Deep Mind AI would very quickly uncover what's going on. \n"", 'What i oppose is your absolute opinion that it ""Will Not happen"", it is my opinion that it is possible.\nI disagree about the Go study. I suspect most, if not every, professional Go player is studying the AIs games in an attempt to gain an advantage over their human peers. Deep mind made a special kind of processor they call a tensor processing unit (TPU) in order to handle the processing of the neural network. Humans are not physically capable of doing the processing the computer is doing in real time.\nYou talked about the doomsday scenarios, I think one of the better ones was in Terminator 3. Spoiler alert: the AI made the defense computers act weird and tricked the humans into thinking they were being hacked by a rival nation. They thought maybe the AI could help them ward off the threat so they transferred the computers over to the AI which then took over.\n', ""\nVery intelligent does not mean infallible. It could be near-perfect in its judgement, but it will never be omniscient. It would definitely be capable of making mistakes.\n\nYes, but it wouldn't step into HUGE mistakes such as letting us know that it is trying to kill all humans before it had all but made sure it couldn't be shut down.\nSo it very well may play the long game and pretend to be friendly while it seizes control in ways that aren't apparent.\nIt actually wouldn't be too hard for the AI to get to the point where a coordinated effort could shut it down, but can't because it has removed our ability to coordinate on that level.  It would hide what its doing so people don't know it's evil, it would use propaganda to make us think it is good, it would pay people to improve it and give it more tools and may disguise itself so people don't know they are working for an AI.  So while one country may be making progress in purging the AI from its computer systems, the people in another country may be building it controllable robots and may not even realize what they're doing.\nHow hard would it be to, before doing anything else remotely suspicious, the first couple actions might be to make some money (stock market, hacking banking systems, etc) and using that money to start building robots in some remote chinese factory for it to control.  It could arrange it all by email and the people may not even know they're working for an AI.  With enough robots, the AI could start up its own factory with the robots and start turning out a robot army all the while it appears to be behaving normally in its normal tasks to the people that built it.\n"", ""\nHere is my reasoning: in order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings. Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes.\n\nIt doesn’t have to have a military purpose. A hospital AI might intentionally alter patient data, leading to inappropriate medical decisions (that can result in death) for example. \n\nfor some reason decides that it wants to do as much damage to humanity as possible (why would it? Presumably that would be against its programming after all)\n\nI mean an AI would do what’s in it’s programing, but the programing might evolve. One example is the Paperclip Maximizer where you make an AI to make paperclips, and it decides the best way to do that is to use all metal for paperclips, even metal that’s need for other things humans want. \n\nExactly...what next? Most modern military weaponry isn't remotely controlled, let alone internet-connected, and implementing these features in modern weaponry with the exception of drones (of which there is a very small amount compared to the rest of the military) would be undesirable, so it won't happen.\n\nMaybe it could manipulate internet sources of information for example, and lead to a subtle misinformation campaign? If it increase the despair on climate change for example, the planet heats up and humans go extinct. It increases fear of vaccines, and eventually diseases like measles and polio come back to start killing off humans again. \nIncrease people’s fear of the government, and suddenly collective action to fix problems is much harder.\n\nThe AI is incorporeal, it can't stop a mammal with wire cutters, or a physical switch in a power station.\n\nSure, but what about if it was backed up on a solar powered satellite for example? You’re basically talking about turning off all electricity at once, which would both be difficult, and lethal to some people (like those on life support). \n\nEven in the absolute worst case scenario where it could theoretically kill off the human race (though I believe this scenario to be impossible for the reasons above) the humans would just kill it first.\n\nIf it had access to either highly lethal biological weapons, or enough nuclear weapons to cause a cascading climate effect, or even was subtle enough to alter human behavior, all of these things can lead to a game over for humanity. \n"", ""\nRogue Medical AI\n\nSurely a tragedy.

And 60% government workers and private contracts will plug in a found USB drive into a computer. 90% if it has an official logo. \nPlus you are discounting the idea of human collaborators. I can imagine a terrorist group that makes an AI to take control of the US’s weapons systems. The AI decides it really wants to wipe out all humans. The terrorists throw it on an appropriate USB drive, leave it in the parking lot, it gets inserted, and now the AI has nuclear weapons.\nOr the government might have made it itself. For example, you have an AI that’s told to kill all members of Al-Qaeda, wherever they are. Even if they are hiding in caves in Afghanistan or whatever.  It has access to the nuclear weapons, and decides the most expedient course of action is a nuclear winter. Massive fallout, huge atmospheric dust cloud, humans go bye bye (but so do all members of Al-Qaeda). \n\nIf humans left nuclear missiles connected to a network which would enable them to be launched with anything but manual operation, the AI could use them. However, I do not think humanity is stupid enough to do this.\n\nAnd the reason to have an AI control your nukes, is to have a deadman’s switch for retaliation. Say North Korea makes a deadman’s switch AI, it fires one a nuke at DC and at Moscow, the US and Russia retaliate, game over. Why does NK have an AI for this?

Drones can react much faster if a human does not need to be ""in the loop"" for all decisions.

An AI wouldn't have to decide to kill the human race. It wouldn't have to have any motivation at all. Regardless of motivation, there are endless possibilities how AI could become our downfall. Most of this hinges on the fact that soon AI will be operating at well above our capacity to respond to it and control it in ways that we would typically respond to problems and control tools. With no regulation, it is certain that AI will be developed that will create more AI in order to more efficiently complete goals. Moreover, it is certain that AI will be created that will be tasked with creating other AI that are better at creating AI to complete tasks. Because AI will inevitably be exponentially more sophisticated than us, this kind of unregulated AI development will happen FAR faster than we can even comprehend let alone respond to.

Are you telling me that you can't even comprehend a disastrous scenario that could arise from 20,000 generations of change in AI that are developed with the goal of cleaning up the environment?  And the only restrictions on that development was done by flawed humans 20,000 generations ago with no regulation? Its not even possible to you that of all the millions  of solutions for changing  environment that AI conceives, none or them could have  unintended horrible consequences? It's easy to see how something like this could go disastrous. \n"", ""All you've said I do accept as possible.\nAn AI developing more efficient AI and leading to hundreds of years' worth of research being done in no time.

So far all it has is a goal. It doesn't have anything with which to accomplish it.\n"", ""Why would you say the AI won't have any tools at it's disposal. The AI will literally be charged with creating machines to solve these problems. The limitations on what those machines can do will be solely at the discretion of the flawed unregulated humans who dozens of years before set the AI on this mission. This is more than possiblity. We already know that inadvertantly consequences are common if not expected when designing solutions. Unlike an AI who is designed purely to complete one task and is only limited by the ancient programming of flawed programmers, humans typically have been able to use common sense to observe when science and engineering could have a disastrous effect and stop it. The few times humans have screwed this up, at lest the implementation of the new science was slow enough that we could do something about it. In the case of thousands of generations of robots being programmed with one goal by flawed humans and given the tools to carry out that goal exponentially faster than humans ever could, disaster is more than possible. \n"", ""The issue is less that the AI would choose any of the scenario's you mentioned but more it would choose an entirely new vector. The classic example is Amazon resume AI. \n\u200b\nBasically the AI was required to rate resumes, based upon what the human though we be a good worker. So the human choose the resumes, and the AI learned from them.\n\u200b\nThe AI quickly started not recommending women, because Amazon was less likely to hire them. So they programmed the AI to ignore the Gender of the applicant, in this case removing it from the database.\n\u200b\nBut as the AI was required to find the best person and Amazon didn't would hire women less than men, it just got better and better at determine if a resume was a woman. This is similar to the concept in AI called a Generative Adversarial Network. Amazon was unable to fix the AI, because they had limited control of how it learned, only that it was rewarded.\n\u200b\nTo take this point further, if we assume that the U.S.A. political landscape is worst then it was 10 years ago, and that is in part because of social media, it begs the question what is controlling social media. In this case it's a series of machine learning software, that are being programmed to keep people engaged on the site. Since learning machine can not evaluate the political landscape and only watch time and user retention it you see the machine learning solution disregarded one to focus on the other.\n\u200b\nSo this issue is less that the AI does something that all humans agree is negative, but more that AI does something that benefits a continually shrinking number of humans.\n"", ""First of all thank you, I had not heard about this, the article was a pretty funny read.\nRegarding your point, I don't really see how this scenario would play out.

If the AI finds a method to jump the air gap - that is, if it can find a way to upload new software into an isolated military network, then it can take control of whatever hardware it can get access to. \nThere are several ways it might do that, and it has essentially unlimited time to think about it and plan. It could trick an unsuspecting human into plugging a compromised device into a machine on the network, or find a willing saboteur. It could look for vulnerabilities in unintentional communication channels. Hell, if it can get into Boston Dynamics it could take over a walking robot and find a way to walk up to the network and plug in something.

People with longer hair are able to perform the same actions without any hinderences that someone with longer hair could perform.

All Female beauty standards are meant to signal youth and fertility since the male sexuality evolved to find fertile young  fertile women attractive.  The biological function of Sex is to produce children, and all genes within the human body evolved because every single one of your ancestors survived to adulthood and successfully reproduced.  Child bearing age Healthy Fertile women are the only women that can have children.  Makeup, clothing, hair, plastic surgery, etc all try to make women look younger, healthy, and more fertile.  Clothes accentuate curves of the hips.  A .7 hip to waist ratio has been the one female beauty ideal consistent across both history an cultures.  This is because a .7 human hip to waste ratio is the widest a woman's hips and physically be and still be able to walk.  Wide hips evolved as human brain size increased.\nWomen selected males for higher intelligence, and Males selected women for fertility.  In humans our brains or sort of like Peacock Feathers.  A peacocks Feathers grew huge not because of any survival function, but as a signal for healthy genes.  If a male Peacock was able to survive with such huge feathers without getting eaten, that is a signal the male is strong and has good genes, then the female peacocks will all mate with him.  The same goes for the human brain.  Males with the highest levels of intelligence and strength were the leaders of human tribes, and the high status big brained tribal leaders got to sleep with all of the women while the lower males on the totem pole didn't.  This changed after the invention of agriculture since human survival and reproduction strategy shifted from hunter gatherer bands to agrarian towns and cities, however this is very recent and human sexuality evolved for hundreds of millions of years in the hunter gatherer society. This is why modern sexual monogamy norms had to be enforced via marriage and laws instead of people being monogamous without socially constructed artificial incentives and punishments.  Some primates are naturally monogamous, humans aren't and nether are our closes primate relatives, Chimpanzees, and Bonobos.\nLong story short long healthy hair is a female fertility indicator, which is why most men find it attractive, and the vast majority of human cultures throughout history had beauty standards with long hair in women.  Male fashion standards vary much more widely culture to culture since Female sexuality didn't evolve to reproduce with the male that is the most fertile, but rather whoever was the highest status and wealth which is a signal for good genes and high intelligence.  A high status male has genes that will ensure their sons are also high status males who have a better chance at reproducing.  Different cultures and sub cultures have different fashion for men representing status.  For some it is long hair and a beard, for others it is short hair in a suit, who can fit the most bones through their nose, decking themselves out in gold jewelry and Air Jordan's, wearing a flashy pimp suit with a cane covered in diamonds, etc.  However for women, the beauty signals nearly 100% geared toward trying to look young, healthy, and fertile and long hair is simply one of many ways of doing that.  Typically there are mostly 3 kinds of women who have short hair, Feminists, Old Ladies, and Lesbians who are deliberately not trying to get male attention.\n"", ""If I'm understanding your argument correctly, the reason why women have long hair is because it is seen as being for youth and fertility. However, this doesn't really address the male components of attraction. With the current argument, it should be that men are of any sort of length of hair and women are longer haired because that is a sign of beauty.

Each one tells themselves that they vote Party A because of issue A, but because they do not support Party A\'s other issues they are not morally responsible and should not be held accountable for those other actions that Party A does because they, themselves do not support those particular actions and were only voting for Party A for issue A.  \nI\'m not sure if that made complete sense, MLK wrote about this topic much more eloquently.  ""History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."" and ""The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.""\nI\'m not saying that if you decide issue A is the most important thing in the world to you that you are \'evil\' for voting that Party A.  However, you should acknowledge that you are also supporting, indirectly, those other items on the platform that come along with your issue A.  So it is not a stretch for an \'outsider\' to say that you support those X, Y, and Z issues- because you have, through your support of Party A.  \nNote: Even with a 3 party or more system this issue is not magically resolved, there will always be things you agree and disagree with.  You just have to make a personal decision on the balancing of your personal values and morals what you are willing to accept to get issue A.  \n', ""Do you:\n\nbelieve in building a wall\nbelieve in lower taxes for the rich\nbelieve in eliminating the death tax\nbelieve immigrants are a problem\nbelieve Muslims are terrorists\nbelieve Hillary belongs in prison\nbelieve Obama isn't American\nbelieve Obamacare is a disaster\nbelieve Dodd-Frank is a disaster\nbelieve Russian interference is a democratic distraction\nbelieve the FBI is unfairly attacking Trump\nbelieve Planned Parenthood should be defunded\nbelieve tax cuts pay for themselves\nbelieve DACA is bad\nbelieve they should get rid of the individual mandate\nbelieve CNN is fake news\nbelieve NPR and PBS should be defunded\nbelieve Mr. Rogers is evil\nbelieve that you shouldn't have gun control\n\nYes, not everyone believes the same thing.

You might see the stance on gay marriage as an affront to civil liberty or basic human emotion, and that might take priority over whatever complaints you have about the Democrats.

Also, dissent from within a party is much more effective than dissent from without.\nSecond - There are views that are so deeply held that it’s hard to excuse someone for belonging to a party that opposes that view.\nOn the right, an example is abortion. People who are single-issue abortion voters don’t care what disagreements a Democrat has with the Democratic Party; by being a Democrat you’re supporting abortion and that makes you an enemy.\nOn the left, an example is climate change.

But I believe that anyone can be married to anyone.\n\nYou are so totally wrong.\nRepublican is party affiliation.  Sall ""r"" republican is a political stance in opposition to monarchy or a monarchical government (see Ireland).\nYour political views are based on a political doctrine, philosophy or ideology and not party affiliation since party is a group of people with a common political interest (i.e. power) and any  ideology or any platfor is instrumental to that purpose. If one ideology is becoming a problem they can change it.  Your views are your personal views and stem from your personality and your circumstance.  When you describe your political views you should therefore use appropriate terms: you are a liberal conservative or moderate conservative or libertarian or even liberal ( in European i.e. correct political classification)\nThe idea that the world is split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents is a two-party system propaganda and I do emphasize the word propaganda.  At least the similarly deceptive split into ""conservatives"" and ""liberals"" refers to broad ideologies and not party allegiance. But even that is wrong as there are no uniform two sides with undecided people (independents, moderates, centrists, whatever) but two loose coalitions of diverse voting blocs.\nCompare it with Europe where you can have three socialist parties, two liberal parties, a conservative (christian democrat) party and a popular/agrarian party in a parliament and that will still not include half of the parties that did not cross the voting threshold.  \nThe people in Europe are not different from America. It is only that your political establishment lies to you and brainwashes you into believing a complete fabrication that benefits said establishment.\nIt is the main reason why America is such a highly divided place.  There is so much of this warped understanding of American politics, far more even than in Britain from where the traditions originated. In Britain you can be a ""tory"" which means a conservative but that is mostly traditional since you can also be a liberal and vote for the Tories. You can be liberal and vote for Liberal Democrats and you can be liberal and vote for Labour although it was traditionally a socialist party. In fact in 20th century Britain become more European/Continental in its political tradition while America kept the old Tory/Whig duopoly that only evolves through consecutive party systems.\nIn short. It is wrong and pathological and it is as close to a genuine ""conspiracy"" as you can get in politics. It is a conspiracy of both parties to maintain the status quo which benefits them and it includes the Republicans as well as the Democrats who ruled the US for over 50 years from 1932 to 1996. Democrats controlled the Congress for 60 years, the Senate for 50 years of senate, and the President for 34 years. Don\'t let the reddit Democrat-sponsored hivemind tell you that it is just your party that is at fault. In fact it is only very recently that they can be really blamed for anything since even during the ""evil Reagan"" era Dems controlled the House.\nThis is a very toxic view of the world that leads to serious issues and unnecessary politicization of everyday life since it ties political party allegiance or a ""team"" to any of your ideological decisions. This is how the parties like it because it keeps you artificially divided whether along those lines or along race, sex, religion whatever.\nConsider feminism - it really shows how this dynamic works in larger sphere of public discourse in America. \nIn Europe it is a sub-section of ""women\'s movements"" and - especially in the former Soviet bloc - a highly irrelevant and generally shunned one. Since women\'s rights were in various countries promoted by socialist (various strands and parties!) and liberal (less conservative) factions and there is a high disconnect between party and ideology then feminism is perceived as one of many ways of approaching the issue. There are feminists but they mostly exist within larger political structures in mainstream left and in particular in fringe radical parties  on the far left. In America however feminism managed to establish itself as the women\'s advocacy in general public discourse since it is the most overtly political of ideologies concerning gender and Democrats being a huge political blob of ""everyone who is not Republican"" became their playground.\nSee election in 2012, 2016 and currently for results.\nAnd you could go on and point to other similar developments where a small group of highly organized ideologues managed to hijack a broad group of potential supporters. It\'s almost like a marketing/sales approach where you Xerox a document, Google information, Skype friends, Facebook that chick from maths class and Fedex your broken laptop.\nOr alternatively it\'s just like Christianity claiming the moral monopoly i.e. why it is harder to be elected President in America if you are an ethical white male successful businessman and atheist, compared to a crooked black lesbian Muslim trans advocate and former prostitute.\n', 'I\'m not sure where  the actual problem is, to be honest. I get that people generally old a plurality of views and that their beliefs do not generally align with the party 110%. I recognize that and don\'t think it\'s necessarily productive to ascribe all republicans beliefs to you. There\'s no real point in doing that.\nYet, whether you disagree with some ""republican values"" or buy them wholesale, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn\'t amount to much of a difference because you still support the whole. It\'s not like you can grade your vote. \n', 'What is your need to associate closely with Republicans and call yourself one if you disagree with them?\n', ""I'll bite.\nPeople shouldn't stop assuming that someone believes all party beliefs. \nFirstly, the binary system we have now allows us to set a reasonable expectation of who someone is on the aggregate. \nGeneralizing is how people are and it's human nature to group things together. You're never going to be able to deprogram our entire evolutionary history. \nSo if we establish that most people who self identify as left or right usually share a plurality of those views then there isn't any reason not to assume they have most of those common left/right views. It's a completely reasonable assumption to make. \nNow here's why this a bad thing. It's perfectly fine to internally assume that if someone says they're republican you then start internally running down the list in your mind of what they're most likely to think. The problem with this is that more often than not, the majority of people care far more about their opinions and being right than they do about cooperation and finding common ground with people with opposing viewpoints. \nSo ultimately what ends up happening is, I tell someone I'm a conservative, they tell me I'm a Nazi and then they never make it past that first snap judgement to ask me why. They just assume that they have all the information they need to make a value judgement against my character which neither broadens their horizons or let's them see me as a person and not some fictitious villain.\nThe problem is not that someone is assuming you toe the party lines on all issues; the issue is that they can't look past that to see you as an individual. \n"", ""If you don't believe in one of their main things, then no you aren't a Republican. It makes no sense. It's like saying you are a KKK member but you like Jews.\n"", 'That’s why instead of using parties like Republicans and Democrats, it’s easier to use labels like centrist, social liberal, fiscal conservative, social conservative, alt right, libertarian etc. \nThat to me is more accurate in terms of understanding someone’s viewpoint. Within liberals and conservatives there are multiple factions. \n', 'But the thing is that typically is the case. People like for things to be simple and often don’t want to have to have an internal debate about everything they believe. It’s easier to pick the side that you like, think is right, and generally agree with and then accept the party line when it comes to the issues even if you thought about it you might not fully agree. Plus disagreeing with the party line puts you at odds with the mob or the tribe and most people don’t want that so they go along to get along.\nPlus, people typically listen to media outlets for their “side”. This further entrenches them by hearing their side’s talking points and platitudes repeated over and over so they have mantras to use as a weapon against their own contradictory thoughts. The party line is this easier to toe.\nThis is why it’s not surprising that when you ask one person on one “side” politically about the issues you can generally predict almost everything they believe/agree with. It’s rare to talk to a republican who isn’t pro-life, anti-gun control, anti-immigration, pro-tax cuts, anti-socialized healthcare and education, anti-welfare, anti-climate change (doesn’t believe it exists), and anti-marijuana legalization. It’s rare to talk to a Democrat who isn’t pro-choice, pro-gun control, pro-immigration, anti-corporate welfare, pro-socialized healthcare and education (to differing extents albeit), pro-welfare, pro-climate change(believes it exists), and pro marijuana-legalization. If a Republican or Democrat said aloud, amongst people who are on their side politically, that they vehemently disagree with one of those points they’d probably have a serious argument on their hands that might end in name-calling.\nI say all that to say this: to an extent you’re right that your party persuasion doesn’t determine everything about you but it definitely is a great predictor or what you believe. Now should people judge your character based on the belief? I think it depends on the belief itself and why you hold that belief. If you opposed welfare because you believed poor people are a drain on the country and deserve to be left to die, I’d probably conclude that you’re a shitty person. If you opposed it because you thought there was a better way to help people, I’d acknowledge that we may have a difference of opinion but I wouldn’t judge you as a person in a negative light.\n', ""I am an independent progressive. I've watched the Democratic party bash progressives for years while paying lip service to social issues and being center to center-right on foreign policy, Wall Street regulations, and especially on issues regarding all the money swirling around Congress. The hot topic right now is how radical mainstream Democrats are and how scary and new that is. Mainstream Democrats have been moving to the right for decades to appeal to moderates and to pad their pocketbooks, and only recently have started to shift back left when they finally started to realize the were losing more of their base than was being gained in new moderate voters. This isn't new, it's a return to a compromise second approach rather than compromise first, and is more aligned with the largest portions of their base. \nMy point is, I'm still an independent progressive. I could have called myself a member of the Democratic party the whole time and been more right than wrong on sheer percentage. Hell, I'm probably 70-80% aligned at this point in the shift, at least with the rhetoric, and that's pretty damn high.

No, I will vote based on the policies that the men and women running align themselves with, and when that means I'm voting Republican (very rare, best example I have is the mayor of my town after years of a corrupt Democrat) or independent or third party (unless it's the general election for president, I'm not interested in lighting that particular vote on fire) so be it. \nYou should figure out what's important to you and define yourself by that.

I disagree with you because you are the one who has labeled yourself, and the onus is on you to change that. People are justified in their assessment of you as a Republican, because at minimum you are a benign accomplice to all the ideas Republicans espouse. Even if that isn't 100% accurate, nobody sees you fighting the monster from within, debating Republicans on conservatism, fighting Republicans when they are harmful to your sensibilities. They see you as accepting those things and they are justified in that because most of them have no way to see otherwise.\n"", '\nI’m a Republican.

(This is a hypothetical, not saying the democrats support higher corporate taxes and not trying to get into the details of this example) if I believe in low corporate taxes and still vote democrat that’s fine. But if I said “I’m a democrat but support low corporate taxes” you’d rightfully question my moral stance on that issue.\nClearly it’s an issue that doesn’t have priority in my mind. And clearly there other issues that I see as being more important.\nI think the distinction is that there is often disagreement within the democrat part over matters of policy. (As there is with the Republican Party)\nBut there is only one party that doesn’t support the rights of marginalised groups like LGBTQ. And so long as you support that party there is no way you can justify being a person in support of gay marriage.\nHere’s another example.\nLet’s say the democrats were defending slavery. But abe lincoln comes along and wants to abolish slavery. Even if I disagree with ALL the prevailing republican policy of the time, the moral stance is to support the republicans.\nOf course you could NOT support the republicans and say that you just find the rest of their policy too abhorrent or disagreeable... but then can I really claim to oppose slavery? Or attribute that label to myself? Sure maybe on paper, but to what extent do I really oppose it? Are you going to be very convinced if I tell you “well I just don’t like their tax policy but I really support ending slavery!”\nMaybe you’ll differentiate me between a card carrying KKK member sure, but odds are you’re still going to judge me for my priorities and question how much I really support ending slavery.\nSo when someone says they support gay marriage but they are a republican, I’m just a bit skeptical and not all that convinced of your the conviction in your views.\nLet’s say you had a sibling who was gay, would you feel comfortable telling them you support their right to get married but you just align more with republican policy? What if your girl/boy friend was bisexual? What if it was a close friend who was gay?\nYou don’t REALLY support gay marriage you just don’t oppose it.\n', 'My roommate and I have had a similar discussion to this. We were talking in the context of the presidential election. Someone we knew claimed that every person who voted for Trump was racist. My roommate and I both disagreed with this, though in different ways. Essentially what it boiled down to was that you don’t have to believe a certain perspective to support it with your vote.\nVoters vote for people, and not particular issues. Lets say, for example, (I’m not claiming this as true, it’s purely a hypothetical) that Trump’s immigration policies are objectively racist (again, not claiming that’s how it actually is, just using it as an example). Someone can be a strong supporter of a conservative economic agenda and have no racist feelings toward minorities. If that person votes for Trump for his economic policies, that vote supports all of Trump’s platform, and therefore also supports the racist immigration policies. They may not have voted for him because of the immigration policies, but their vote still forwarded that cause. So in this case it isn’t fair to call that person a racist for voting for Trump, but it is fair to say that person’s vote supported racist policies.\nThis is a similar issue. You may not have any negativity towards marriage equality, and it would not be okay to assume you do. But someone could claim that your vote supported the platform that fought against marriage equality, and therefore that your vote still damaged that cause. I think it’s still valid to criticize people for this, but not to assume that is their view.\n', 'Sounds like you\'ve already delta\'d, but to draw further from your example about gay marriage, I guess it depends on what you think is a cornerstone of your belief.

You\'re right in that no political party or platform is is likely to align perfectly with any one person\'s views; lots of these values are not mutually exclusive across platforms, but there\'s a big difference between ""marry whoever you want so long as it doesn\'t affect me, but I won\'t triumph your right to do so"" and seeing the blocking of that right as something that isn\'t trivial enough to see as a side-issue.\n', ""> Due to the political “stereotypes” running around, I sometimes call myself a centrist. \n\u200b\nSurely a centrist would be more aligned with the Democrats seeing as they're a centre-right leaning party?\n"", ""Maybe this isn't a direct answer to your question, but I've really come to see these political categories as the single most destructive force in current political discourse.

Politics is a game that rewards good acting skills so I don’t take emotional slogans like “hope” very seriously. The country needs pragmatic, level-headed solutions to wealth disparity, climate change, prison, healthcare, and education reform. The problem with free market toting republicans is that they are unwittingly defending giant banks and corporations who are actively funneling money from the poor to the rich and destroying the environment.

So when you identify as a particular ideology, you\'ll automatically open yourself up to all kinds of interpretation that isn\'t under your control. You cannot control the general message of feminism, you cannot control what other feminists say about feminism, you cannot control how others view feminism.

4,svenson_26,"I'll start by saying that I believe password strength is very important, and that users should try to have strong, unique passwords.   When websites force restrictions on passwords, they are reducing security.
By forcing a password to be over 8 characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that are less than 8 characters.
By forcing a password to contain numbers and/or special characters, they are eliminating all possible passwords that do not contain numbers and/or special characters.
The result is there are less possible passwords for a ""hacker"" to choose from if they are trying to randomly guess. Furthermore, there are patterns hackers can follow. Most people use patterns when adding numbers and special characters to accounts. They replace certain letters with numbers/sp chars, or they add the numbers/sp chars to the end.  When passwords are forced to be more complicated, or when websites force users to change their passwords often, the odds of users forgetting passwords will increase. As someone who has worked in IT, I can say that the easiest way to guess a user's password is to read the stickynote stuck to the computer. People write down passwords when they can't remember them. It makes it very easy to gain access to their account; even easier than if they had a very common password such as ""letmein"". When users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account. This reduces overall security, because if any of those things I just mentioned are hacked, then a ""hacker"" can easily gain access to the user's account without having to guess their password.   For example, if I can see that their account recovery question is ""What was my mother's maiden name?"", then that is almost certainly easier to guess than it would be to guess their password. The overall security is reduced. Instead of forcing password restrictions, users should have the freedom to choose a password as ""strong"" or as ""weak"" as they wish. Inform the users when they are making their account how strong their passwords are, and give recommendations. They should also inform users not to use the same password for multiple websites, and to update their passwords often. But at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion. CMV!This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

Each member can only create a password that a. contains numbers, b. is 1, 2, or 3 characters long, and c. does not start with ""0"", ""00"", or ""000"". These limitations exist so that the math is less complicated. Basically, members can use any number from 1 to 999 as their password. We will also assume that accounts will become locked after 5 failed attempts to sign in.\nIt seems as though any hacker will only have a 5 in 999 chance of guessing any user\'s password. However, it is likely that some members only used a 1 digit password (to simulate people who use overly short and simple passwords). So instead of trying to guess 5 of every possible password, the hacker only guesses 5 of the 9 possible single digit passwords.\nOn our website, 3 members are using a single digit password, 3 members are using a two digit password, and 4 members are using a three digit password. The three members using the single digit password now have a 5 in 9 chance of getting hacked!\nAfter two members on the site complain about being hacked, you decide that all members must now use 3 digit passwords. This means members must pick a number from 100 to 999.\nNow, all 10 users have 3 digit passwords. The hacker can no longer take advantage of people with weak passwords and is forced to tackle 3 digits. Now, everyone only has a 5 in 900 chance of getting hacked.\nEven though we went from 999 possible passwords to 900 possible passwords, everyone is more secure as a whole!\nOf course this example is overly simplified, but I hope it demonstrates why it\'s better to limit the number of possible passwords to prevent hackers from targeting those with weaker passwords.\nWith that said, I do agree with some of your other points regarding complex passwords. Forcing people to make complex passwords often leads to cliches as you\'ve mentioned before. However, your argument that there are less possible passwords when you implement limits is not a valid argument because hackers will only focus on those with weak passwords.\n', '\nInstead of forcing password restrictions, users should have the freedom to choose a password as ""strong"" or as ""weak"" as they wish.

They should also inform users not to use the same password for multiple websites, and to update their passwords often. But at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion.  \n\nBy allowing users to have weak passwords, you open up more possibilities for your customers accounts to be \'hacked\'. That means more customers calling to have their information restored. You would have to bulk up your customer service department to handle many more \'account fraud\' claims. \n', ""\nSecurity\n\nReading people's notes isn't really that big of a big threat. Requiring physical access to compromise password reduces attack surface from 'all of internet' to 'people in your city who have access to you'. That is a massive help.\nWhile yes requiring pattern reduces possible password, requiring certain length increases it by exponentially so it usually works out to be better to have longer passwords.\nI'm not going to argue your point on security questions; I've no idea who thought asking people same, random seeming question whose answer is likely public/common anyways was a good idea, or why they continue to stick around. Just use authy or text codes.\n\nBut at the end of the day, let the user choose whatever password they wish at their own discretion.\n\nIn some sense I agree with you - ultimately password is user's responsibility and if account is compromised because someone decided to use 1234 as a password thats really on them. \nProblem comes when you consider that's not how our society treats 'hacks'.

While it doesn't specify specific measures, do you really want to stand infront of a court and argue why you chose not to implement no cost, industry standard 8 character requirement? Ultimately its just not feasible in business sense. \nFor reference, this is what GDPR says:\n\nTaking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:\n\n"", 'Surely there should be SOME limit.

They replace certain letters with numbers/sp chars, or they add the numbers/sp chars to the end.\n\nWhile I agree that forcing numbers often leads to a ""1!"" at the start or a ""!1"" end or a ""123"" or a ""999"", there are still a lot of varieties that are typically used and it adds security.\n\nWhen users forget passwords often, websites employ methods such as attaching email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and recovery questions to the account.\n\nAre you saying we could get rid of those systems if we had easier password restrictions? No, we\'d still need those exact same systems.  You\'d just have people walking around with 3 character passwords that aren\'t offering them much in the way of protection.\n', '\nSurely there should be SOME limit. Are you really going to build out your system to allow people to use passwords that are 100,000,000 characters long just so you have no limits?\n\nThat\'s a good point. I should have specified that there obviously has to be some limit.   Δ  \n\nis that really a restriction that you\'d consider a meaningful reduction?   \n\nYes. It is. It eliminates 1% of all possible passwords, aka 1008 passwords, aka 10 quadrillion passwords. That is a significant chunk.\nIf you consider all <9 digit passwords ""instantly crackable"", so you might as well eliminate them, then consider this:  It would take exactly the same time to guess all passwords that started with a 1. You even mentioned yourself, that passwords often start with a 1. By the same logic, all these passwords are now ""instantly crackable"", because that is logically where a password guessing algorithm would start.\nObviously, if you kept going making further restrictions such as banning leading ones, then you will be reducing the pool of possible passwords.\n', '\nYes. It is. It eliminates 1% of all possible passwords, aka 1008 passwords, aka 10 quadrillion passwords. That is a significant chunk.\n\nI don\'t see how that is significant to anyone.  For people that already use strong passwords it is irrelevant because they are already using 12+ characters, so removing the passwords with 8 or fewer characters is only going to be just as restrictive as saying, ""You can\'t start your password with these exact 4 characters in this exact order: SVEN"".  That is meaninglessly restrictive.  Next you\'re going to tell me that the restriction, ""Your password can\'t be the same as your username"" adds insecurity because it narrows down the amount of possible passwords.\nIt only removes 1% of the passwords in the case where you\'re using the bare minimum character length.  And even if it did remove 1% of the password space for people using 12+ characters (which it doesn\'t), having a proper password it isn\'t going to matter if it takes 10,000 years to crack or 9,900 years to crack, that is an uncrackable password in either case.\nFor people that want to use shorter passwords it\'s going to vastly increase their security.  So yes, you\'re sacraficing 1% of the brute force security for people using the bare minimum length but that forces others to use a pool of passwords that is 100 or 100x100 or 100x100x100 times larger.\n', ""\nYes.

However, there is no reason why those must be the account recovery questions if you allow for complex passwords.

Any password of 10 characters or less is immediately compromised for any organization which has had a password hash leak.\nSuch organizations include Yahoo and Sony. Have a Yahoo email?

By comparison, an 8 character password would have 40 bits of entropy so \'cutting off\' the short passwords only costs about 1/16 of the possible password space.   In other words it makes naive guessing take 15/16 as long.  That\'s not a significant factor for the purposes of cracking.

5,treesinthestairs,"The furry fandom functions as a fetish community. It is awash in porn and essentially is a fetish. There may well be a social community and non-sexual things that occur, but the interest is sexual in nature. There is nothing wrong with it, per se, but people like teenagers should steer clear until they're able to legally view porn where they reside. It is not a family friendly fandom.Porn:
One could say that other fandoms have sexual aspects and porn, but you are lying to yourself if you think that the furry fandom doesn't revolve around porn in a way that other fandoms do not. Rule 34 is absolutely a thing, but porn is not as central to other fandoms.Let's take Overwatch. Because while there is a ton of porn of it, Overwatch is, predominately, about playing a video game. Porn of Overwatch characters is a minor component and one can definitely like overwatch and have people assume that they look at Overwatch porn.Or what about anime? Anime absolutely has a perverted side, but you can definitely be a fan of anime without people assuming that you are looking at hentai. There are things you can share with other people that they can appreciate on various non-sexual levels.But for the furry fandom? Porn is so central to everything. Pretty much Disney movies, some kemono anime, some cartoon shows, and then... Porn of all that plus OC. There isn't much there that isn't porn. It is virtually impossible to separate yourself from all the porn that is there, which forms the central content most furries like and share a bond with other people over. That's why when one goes to a furry convention, the sales hall is full of porn and more tables sell porn versus a comic con or anime con.You are fooling yourself if you can't see the central place that porn has in the furry community and delusional if you think other interest groups (outside of kink communities) have the same mentality.Conventions:
Conventions are one of those points where you meet people. Conventions have a sense of community and an undertone of various levels of unhealthy sex, from anonymous junk to rape. It is a place where older people often take advantage of people who are lonely, horny, and who don't have a lot of experience with love or sex.Now, is this universal? No. But it is enough to be problematic in a way that other fandoms are not. You don't get this at Comic Con or a Star Trek con or anime con to the same degree. At all. Anime cons would be the closest, but even then it's not on the same level.Other conventions aren't really packed full of the same type of people drawn to the furry fandom. People who feel lonely, isolated, socially inept, horny and who use the furry fandom as an escapist fantasy tend to do more of that at cons than at other conventions. I've been to a bunch. It's not really the same. The amount of sex happening at a con is roughly proportional to the percentage of the sales hall that is devoted to porn and related items. There is an unusual amount of porn being sold at these conventions.Sexuality:
Being part of the furry fandom also fucks with one's sexuality. It will become a secret. It will be something that when they outgrow it hangs around in the background as a source of shame. Explaining it will feel like work and not worth even bringing up. The world will assume the worst. They may also never be rid of the fetish, setting up weird dynamics in the future that would better be avoided for simple ease of life.Moreover, some people will make assumptions about a furry's sexuality in ways that being associated with other fandoms do not. Stating that one likes anime does not mean that people think they have a thing for traps or hentai or catgirls. However, it is common for furries to be associated with people who like their pets a little too much.And some furries know it has enough truth to be problematic for them, if they are honest. Murrsuiters, zoophiles, and pedophiles are definitely at those cons and are part of the community, as much as one might wish them away. The fandom definitely has a problem with these things. They are problematic in a way that hentai is not to the anime fan.If furries go to a convention, they should look for all the non-consensual touching masked as ""pounces"", ""glomping"", etc. Look for pairs of people who aren't of similar ages, but are affectionate (likely unhealthy). Look for collars and think about how that's perceived at the work place. Look for large dogs. Look for people with tattoos of a circle with some type of squiggly line (indicators of a zoophile). Look at the ""normal people"" and decide if that's who they want to be like. How are they perceived by others outside of the fandom? How well adjusted do they seem? People eventually become more like the people they associate with.These are all things that aren't very good. There are hobbies and things that hold big ass conventions that don't feature these things.Fursonas: The function of a fursona is a type of roleplay, where one imagines themselves as a different, usually more perfect, version of them. Having others accept and interact with who they would want to be, uncoupled with the baggage of the real world and the immediacy of interacting with people in real time creates an illusion of a better community than it actually is. Adopting a fursona of what they would want to be allows them to feel empowered.A fursona it is a comforting lie. It's not real. It's a way of coping, but isn't addressing the cause.And that's pretty much all I have. So in conclusion, the furry fandom is a massive sex community that unhealthily revolves around porn and sex, unlike other fandoms and communities out there, and this is why I dislike them.Go ahead, feel free to refute my claims, I'm open.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

I much prefer /r/furry_irl.\nAnother reason is that there are a bunch of people there who consider themselves non-furries who are there anyway. \'Just for the porn\'.\nIt comes from a place of miscommunication or misunderstanding. \'I don\'t want to fuck people in a Fursuit, so I\'m not a furry.\' (you don\'t need to have a desire to buy a suit, nor do you have to want to fuck in it to be a furry.)\nIts also because places like /r/anime and such aren\'t as stigmatized. No one wants to be part of the /r/furry community because everyone thinks it\'s overtly sexual in nature. This stigma falls away around porn because of the taboo nature of off-vanilla porn anyhow. ""why not subscribe, I\'m already subbed to /r/BDSM and /r/handholding"". People who are likely to sub to porn subs, are far more likely to add whatever porn subs they want in their entirety.\nAs for your comparisons, I don\'t believe they are fair comparisons. For any singular TV show, it makes sense that the main sub about a show would dominate compared to any secondary sub (compare /r/stevenuniverse with /r/gregfuckedarock for example) as for the inverse, with anime, it\'s encompassing such a large artform in general, from dumb trash like \'Cat Planet Cuties\' and \'To Love Ru\' to masterpiece quality art like \'Spirited Away\' and \'Your Name\'. It\'s basically an entire genre all its own. It\'s massive nature is reflective of that.

There is probably some molestative elements in furry communities, but there is in all communities because there are child molesters in every community.

We can't and shouldn't revolve our lives around making it impossible for kids to come into contact with sexual expression, because that leaves for a shitty boring society.

6,DoubleDoobie,"Title pretty much explains it all. Dr. McKinnon considers herself female but is still biologically male. I have no issue with Transgenders or those who identify as another gender.

Weight, muscle definition, and testerone all play a factor in her victory. While McKinnon suppresses her testerone, I still am of the opinion that, biologically speaking, she has an advantage.

There was a ton of social pressure on them to accept this change, but they were aware of the possibility this would happen. Their two options are to fight it preemptively (against the current social movement) or just let it happen. If they let it happen there are a few options. Either no trans athletes compete, they compete but don't win, or they win and start crushing dreams and records. In the case of option 3 (which is what we are starting to see) perhaps public opinion will swing back against this policy. In that case the IOC will be able to switch it back without have to deal with the outrage mob.

In fact, even the sports organizations themselves seem to be flying by the seat of their pants, so to speak. As this 2017 review of the literature noted: ""The majority of transgender competitive sport policies that were reviewed were not evidence based."" (Have you ever wondered why the new IAAF policy for women with hyperandroganism is basically restricted to the disciplines in which Caster Semenya competes?)\nThere currently does not seem to be any evidence that transgender women have a systematic competitive advantage in sports (same study), but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, especially if the evidence is so spotty, and the story may be different for individual disciplines, where one specific trait gains outsized importance (such as height in basketball).\nSo, what do we do in the face of uncertainty? This is not a new problem and has affected women with intersex conditions for decades before we even really started to worry about transgender women. The IOC in particular really, really tended to screw over women with intersex conditions, even if there was zero reason to believe that they had a competitive advantage (such as women with CAIS).\nMore recently, the sports courts started to put the onus on sports organizations to prove that the perceived advantage was actually there before implementing policies that may negatively affect the health of athletes and/or be unnecessarily discriminatory (again, that mostly happened in the context of intersex conditions, but much of the rationale could be applied to transgender athletes).\nMoreover, the regular courts have started to get involved, such as in the case of Kristen Worley. Normally, athletes sign away their right to sue before the regular courts and submit themselves to the arbitration of the sports courts, but in the face of the deep corruption that many sports organizations and events suffer (from the FIFA arrests to the Tour de France getting nicknamed Tour de Doping), there is an increasing reluctance in some places to actually let that continue unless the organizations clean up their act.\nThe result is that we have some hastily written policies in place that don\'t really have enough science to back them up. Most seem to focus on keeping testosterone levels low and hoping that this is enough to offset any real or hypothetical advantages that a trans athlete might have. A nasty side effect is that sports organizations seem to be extremely stingy with TUEs (therapeutic use exemptions) for trans women, even where that affects their basic health (because every person, man or woman, needs a minimum level of testosterone for basic functioning). (This was the basis on which Kristen Worley won a settlement.)\nWith that said, much of what you seem to believe about the specific case of McKinnon is based on assumptions that are wrong.\n\nMcKinnon does not suppress testosterone; she is post-op and has endogenous testosterone levels below the normal cis range and that has been the case for years.\nWith the loss of testosterone, you also quickly lose muscle mass. Nobody really argues that trans women (at least post-op) have a competitive advantage when it comes to muscle mass, which disappears rapidly on HRT. Most (real or hypothesized) advantages are believed to be in the long term effects of testosterone and having had a male puberty.\nWeight by itself is not an advantage in cycling (but may be in other disciplines); in fact, the ideal weight is usually in a fairly narrow range depending on your height, slightly different for sprinting and climbing. When people point at the podium picture and think that she has an advantage over her competitors, because she seems to have more bulk ... this isn\'t really how things work in cycling. It\'s even more complicated when it comes to height, especially when you factor in that pro cycling is a team sport.\nThe articles you cite are about the differences between cis men and cis women and only speculate that any male advantages are retained by trans women. But this does not seem to be true for, e.g., hemoglobin levels. HRT does a number on your physiology that goes far beyond just growing breasts. Here is the image of a hand before and after four months of MtF HRT; note how even blood vessels changed over that period. (More on that below.)\n\nThis does not mean that she doesn\'t have an advantage; it means that the situation is inconclusive. And if you look at her entire record, there\'s no evidence of dominance. She\'s won some, but she\'s also placed in the bottom 50% often enough. It\'s consistent with an above average athlete who had a good day. Whether she\'s above average because of effort, because of having had a male puberty, or because of legit genetic differences (remember that sports in large parts is still a genetic lottery) is something that we really cannot tell.\nThe whole situation is hugely complicated:\n\nPost-op trans women generally have lower T levels than cis women, sometimes extremely so. This is because in women both the adrenal glands and the ovaries contribute to testosterone production, and trans women have no ovaries. About 25% of testosterone comes from the adrenal glands, about 25% from the ovaries, the remaining 50% are synthesized from other circulating androgens (which in turn are produced by the adrenal glands and ovaries). Women with an oophorectomy seem to typically experience a drop in 40%-50% of testosterone levels. This is often even more pronounced in adult transitioners, who may require testosterone supplements for basic health.\nPre-op trans women also have their T-levels lowered; however, in their case, we have the problem of policing. What are the effects if a pre-op trans woman goes off anti-androgens for a day every now and then?\nMuscle mass in trans women quickly drops to cis levels on HRT, but the same may not be true for muscle memory.\nHemoglobin levels in trans women seem to be in the cis female range; however, studies are limited and we are not sure if they even are a major factor in performance.\nIt has been speculated that because trans women who have gone through a male puberty have a larger rib cage, they may also have a larger lung capacity and thus VO2max values. However, this has never been really studied and the rare individual assessment of trans women who had their VO2max tested does not seem to back it up.\n\nOn a policy level, there are no easy answers here. We do generally assume that trans women who did not undergo a male puberty do not have a competitive advantage, but even there it becomes difficult to prove that you didn\'t (or that your testosterone was adequately suppressed for the duration). For trans women who did experience male puberty, we just don\'t know enough to make any firm statements one way or the other.\n', ""Do you think anyone who has a biological advantage in a given sport should be disqualified?\nFor example, let's say I was born with a rare condition that allows my lungs to absorb more oxygen than most. This makes me a very effective marathon runner. Should I be disqualified?\n"", ""I appreciate this perspective, but I don't think the argument works because that's not a real medical condition.

What does it mean to have an ""unfair advantage""? If I was allowed to spend eight hours a day practicing swimming from a young age I\'m going to be better than someone who had to quit and get a job when they were 16 to support their dying mother.\nWhat I am getting at here is we look at athletic competitions as being ideal when they\'re between two completely equal opponents (or teams) but that\'s not how reality shakes out. The New York Yankees can afford to pay more money for the best players, a woman with a smaller frame is better at gymnastics, and on and on.\nI honestly don\'t know how to answer the question about trans people in sports.

You note that males have advantages in sports, but muscle mass and weight are strongly linked to testosterone levels and there is a ton of anecdotal evidence that you simply cannot maintain pre-transitioning levels of muscle mass while taking anti-androgens (and likewise, you can see a ton of similar evidence for bodybuilders putting on more mass while blasting testosterone at high doses).\nCycling isn't the same as long distance running, but it seems substantially similar enough that I think it's reasonable to assume the effects are the same.\n"", 'I wonder if in this specific event she could be literally weighed and her muscle mass measured against the other women in the race, would she have come out as the one with more muscle and if she did not have more muscle weight than the other women would that make it fair in your opinion? \n', ""This is a little bit “out there” from the current norm, but would you be at all receptive to the idea that there shouldn’t be gendered competitions at all? \nPerhaps MTF competitors merely expose the oddity of having a separate class of competitors whose events, stats and “winners” are kept segregated by anything other than their raw ability.\nIt is well known that there are genetic oddities surrounding gender, including “men” who have fully XX chromosomes. It seems likely that in the long run, any criteria used to segregate men's and women's competitions will ultimately fall to such oddities and those “naturally abnormal” individuals will come to dominate the ranks and records of women’s sports anyway, so excluding transgender people doesn’t protect gender discriminated sports from the same kind of “unfair” competitors in the long run.\n"", ""The question isn't whether she had a biological advantage.

Is she performing at a much higher physical level than women.\nI can't find the study right now, but I remember reading that they found that testosterone suppression over time led to lower performances. Enough that the significant advantage of being male was not there anymore.\nIf hormone therapy is really changing your muscles and your body overall to act more female, then transgender athletes are fine, given they meet the testosterone levels required.\nMy personal take on this issue is that we need to simply remove gender from sports, and base it on levels of performance. \n"", 'Sorry, u/ray07110 – your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 1:\n\nDirect responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP’s stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question.

7,Chief_Leaf,"I would like to preface this argument by saying I am very pro choice, but I think the discussion around abortion gets distracted, and neither side of the argument actually addresses what the other side is saying.Those who oppose abortion believe that a fetus is in fact a living human being, so it has the right to live. If everyone agreed that a fetus was in fact a human being, then everyone would oppose abortion. My question is, when did this discussion become about the physical body in which the living being was living? If a fetus is considered a human being, its right to live surely should not be decided by the person to whom it’s living inside, right? The entire argument is whether or not a fetus has rights. If the fetus does in fact have rights to live, then it is no longer the right of the woman carrying that fetus to decide its fate. It’s physical location should not affect the moral argument. The discussion should only be about when life begins. I believe it is a woman’s choice to abort a fetus inside of her because the fetus is not a living human being, and therefore she has the right to abort it. But, if I did believe it was a living being, then it would have nothing to do with the fact that the fetus is living inside of the woman.

Clearly, a fetus is a life, and it is human. Life is most coherently defined as a homeostatic chemical system which sustains itself through metabolic processes. A fetus is that. Human is the description given to life which contains genetic markers within a reasonable range to be able to be called ""human"". In that way, fetuses are human life.\nThe reason that I am okay with the termination of fetuses is not because they are human life, but because they are not people. Personhood is a philosophical distinction given to entities which labels them as being worthy of certain protections and respect by other entities with personhood. Personhood is a far more nebulous term in regards to anyone in society, because it is emergent from the wildly varying ethical and moral values of individuals in society, so it is a term that, when it has wildly varying definitions between people, should be expected to have wildly varying definitions, precisely because of the varying standards that all people has at to what is worthy of having their life protected and what doesn\'t. Therefore, I feel justified in both asserting my definition while acknowledging that there will be wildly different definitions throughout society. The reason that fetuses are not something that should be defined as people is that all of the entities who exist in society will quite definitively maximize their overall long term preferences if they give themselves the flexibility to terminate fetuses conceived under inconvenient circumstances.\nThe reason that it is bad for society to treat other grown humans this way is that when we reciprocate good behavior towards people, they become better people who are better able to fulfil our interests. Fetuses cannot be affected by our threats to their life in any negative way, so there is nothing to gain by not making the threat to them a widespread public policy. And we gain a lot when we can terminate them when they are inconvenient. We enable women and even men, to a degree, to more easilly pursue things that will make them more skilled effectively people in society. We will actually create opportunities for better people to be born who otherwise could not have been, because a lot of those women who abort would then go on to have babies later that they would not have had if they had one earlier that they had to spend their resources on.\nAs far as violating consent, insofar as fetuses cannot consent to be killed: all life is non-consensual. You are raped through your dads dick and down your mothers fallopian tube, and you are forcefed through your ambilical cord and just generally kidnapped into existence. Is the consequence of this usually enjoyable enough for most people it creates? Sure. But it is still non-consensual. If an irresponsible thrill seeker seeks out a situation in which they are more likely to get raped, they get raped, trying to resist the whole time, but still being overpowered, even if, in their head, they liked that it happened and wanted someone to genuinely overpower and rape them, that person would still have been raped, even if they secretly wanted it. So the consequence does not matter, just the consent, insofar as arguments from consent go. If a lack of consent makes killing a fetus wrong, then the same lack of consent makes procreation wrong, because procreation is non-consensual, which makes abortion morally equivalent to procreation on that argument.\n', ""\nIf everyone agreed that a fetus was in fact a human being, then everyone would oppose abortion. \n\nNot true. I agree that fetus is a human being, yet I don't oppose abortion. I simply value the freedoms of a woman higher, than the developing kid.\n\nMy question is, when did this discussion become about the physical body in which the living being was living?\n\nYe we call those mothers. It's because women historically don't really had the bodily autonomy. And some people would like to change that.\n\nThe entire argument is whether or not a fetus has rights.\n\nNot really.

It all falls down if you simply disagree that fetus isn't a human, since we don't have an objective definition of a human being.

If said women wants to remove the fetus, then she should be allowed to. The negative outcome to the fetus does not factor into the right of the woman for autonomy of her body. The same logical line of thought which prevents the state for forcing organ donation.\nI don't personally like abortion but I am 100% committed to the concept of near absolute body autonomy.

8,One-vs-1,"TL;DR: Healthcare in the US is a textbook example of price fixing enabled by Insurrance companies and in order to fix it we must break up their ability to collude.First I know next to nothing about the industry but I’ve seen the type of business that healthcare companies run and it’s just an exploitation of the system we’ve created.Within the healthcare industry in the states the hospital has the ability to bill Insurrance companies practically any amount for anything, hence why you see ridiculous charges for frivolous line items, such as billion dollar a year hospitals charging for individual tissues, or the ability to hold your baby after you give birth. This sort of thing in any other industry is tantamount to highway robbery but the medical industry gets a pass because the vast majority of people never see these items, the insurer picks up the bill and it’s forgotten about. So it’s in the hospitals best interest to have these companies as fit and healthy as possible because they can only continue their racketeering unabashed if they have Insurrance companies to match. But if I were to take it a step farther, if you were to look just past initial impressions so to say, this setup is also good for the Insurrance companies. The vast majority of people will pay significantly more into their policy than services they receive. This is obvious because large health insurance companies spatter the Fortune 500 and it’s not unheard of to have executives on 8 figure payrolls. So if you want wider margins, you don’t want cheaper prices, you want more policies. It doesn’t really matter if you have to drop 50k on little Timmy’s MRI for a herniated disk because you have 30 other people that year that never meet their deductible and each of them pays you 15k a year for your “protection”. So how would one go about getting more policies? Well the healthcare in the US is famously expensive. And for most people you can’t exactly go without it now can you? So the Insurrance companies would love for it to cost 2500 every time you visit the ER, because it’s the most effective advertising there is. “Buy what we sell, go broke, or die, pick your poison.” It works to both the hospital and Insurrance’s benefit, hospitals get to frolic in money, insurance companies can all but threaten financial ruin and death upon anyone that doesn’t buy their stuff.  So, make it illegal to sell insurance for healthcare, hospitals will never be able to charge dumb prices, for risk of going broke, and people can utilize an industry the way it’s meant to be, with choices and competition.

When I need emergency care I don\'t have time to call every hospital near me to determine who had the most reasonable prices and best services. And once I show up at the hospital i may not know enough about medicine to understand what they plan to do to me and the associated costs with it. Is that MRI really necessary or could they diagnose it with just a regular x-ray? Is there ""better"" medication really worth the extra money or will I have I there same outcome with the cheaper medicine? \nEven as a doctor I might not know all these answers because my problem might be outside my speciality or maybe it\'s a statistical thing: option A has good outcomes 80% of the time but cost twice as much as option B that has good outcomes 60% of the time.\nI agree the system is broken, but choices and competition aren\'t the real fix. They need to exist, for example my ex had to have emergency surgery and choose to go to one hospital over another because as a nurse, she didn\'t trust the doctor that would do the surgery at the bigger hospital. But for the average consumer, they wouldn\'t know the difference. \n', 'The point is that you should be able to have a competitive choice. Emergency care constitutes a (hopefully) small fraction of your medical costs. All the follow up treatment and care associated once your condition is stable and you’re lucid enough to make decisions should be your choice and the hospitals that administer the best medicine at the most reasonable price in your area should get the most business. You are ultimately the final say as to whether you get an X-ray or an mri, medicine A or B. You should have the choice.\n', ""But it isn't the small part of the cost. For a non-life threatening issue an emergency visit is typically 10 to 15 times the cost of a visit to a doctor's office. For life threatening conditions it can easily be 100 times the cost of the follow up visits. But the other issue is do you know what the best medical decisions are? Most likely not unless you are in the medical field yourself. In the case of my ex, would you have known that the surgeon on call that night at the large hospital in town had worse outcomes than the surgeon on call at the smaller hospital? Would you have even known that you needed emergency surgery and needed to make that decision? There was one follow-up visit, that cost about $120, the surgery cost about $8000. Even if we had wanted to save money by going to a cheaper doctor for the follow up, he would have referred us back to the surgeon that did the procedure.\nAs to whether to have an MRI or an x-ray, would you be able to tell which conditions can be reliably diagnosed with one vs the other? Most can't. They have to rely on the doctors to explain to them the value of one choice vs the other. Can you reasonably weigh the value of one choices potential outcomes vs the others when making a decision about what to do? And also those decisions are typically needing to be made during the emergency phase of a visit. X-ray and MRI are diagnostic tools, so those are going to be done before you are treated. The choice of medicine a or b, you may need to know that while medicine b is cheaper, and it's less likely to work, it is also less likely to make things worse if it falls.\nMy statement was't that the system shouldn't be changed, it's that the system can't support true competition because the customer is always at a knowledge disadvantage.\n"", ""I'm confused, are you advocating for just absolutely no healthcare insurance or a government nhs style?\n"", '\nthe insurer picks up the bill and it’s forgotten about.\n\nThe insurer does NOT just pay whatever.\n\nIn-network hospitals:  These are hospitals that the insurer has made special negotiations with and decided on all prices in advance.  The hospital will often still send a bill for an absurd amount because the contract usually specifies ""The amount previously negotiated or the billed amount, whichever is lower"", but that amount will just not be paid.  Hospital could bill $3,000, the insurer could pay $900 and the patient could pay $100, because the negotiated rate was $1000. Insurers try to steer you towards these because they are cheaper for everyone and also can be thought of as a reward to the hospital for providing a discount.\nOut-of-network hospitals: These are hospitals don\'t have an agreement with your insurer.  In your contract, the insurer might pay 70% instead of 90%, but also have various types of caps.  So if the hospital bills $3000, but that is way above normal for that region for that procedure, the insurer may cap the bill to, say, $2500 and then they\'d 70% of that, meaning the patient might owe $500 for the portion that the insurer wasn\'t covered and also 30% of what is covered (30% of 2500 is $750) because that is what might be in your contract  for using out of network hospitals.  So the patient ends up paying $500+$750, though that would still register against their out of pocket maximum.  Some insurance plans have different out of pocket maximum for out of network providers.\n\n', 'This was brought up earlier but it it’s all gonna come back to this for me, it’s not a 50% discount if it’s price has been marked up 100%. These “negotiated prices” couldn’t ever be viable market prices because the point they start their negotiation from is an arbitrary often exuberant number. If you took the insurers out of the picture prices would be lower than even that negotiated number imo.\n', 'That is not at all accurate.  First, insurers do what they can to keep their product cheap and negotiating good rates is the MOST important part of that and they aren\'t stupid enough to fall for the ""We marked this up so it\'d look like we were giving you a discount"".\nNext, hospitals aren\'t just making bank.  A bunch of hospitals closed last year.  Their operating margin is less than 5%.\n\nIf you took the insurers out of the picture prices would be lower than even that negotiated number imo.\n\nWhen you go to an out of network hospital, where you\'re actually going to end up being responsible for a big chunk of the bill, do you shop around to different hospitals? Do you find out the price? Or do you just throw up your arms and say ""fine"" when the hospital can\'t tell you in advance how much it\'ll cost because it is really really complicated and depends on a lot of factors.  I\'ve been to places that don\'t even accept insurance and finding out prices is very difficult, EVEN if you know exactly what you\'re going to get and who is going to provide it.\nThey use codes to represent what they\'re going to do, and for procedures there is about 8000 of which, many of which you\'d practically need to be an actual MD to tell apart, and that is before you get into all the other coding standards that even a single facility would use, which includes 14,000 diagnosis codes, and that is before you even get into all the specialized coding that hospitals use.\n', 'I agree with your assessment of the problem (crazy prices) but I disagree with the cure you propose. \nIn many countries health insurance doesn’t exist.

I\'ve gotten head tax, poll tax, and flat tax mixed up a few times, but don\'t think I\'ve used it here in this thread other than this one time. The problem is that the Oregon Constitution doesn\'t define very well what a head tax is.

11,McKoijion,"Background:Elizabeth Warren is an incredibly privileged person. She grew up as a middle class white woman in the United States in the 1950s. She is now a tenured Harvard Law School professor turned US Senator.Elizabeth Warren made what I believe is a false claim that she is Native American, one of the least privileged groups in America. In the 1980s and 1990s, when presented a form that asked her for her race, she checked the box that said Native American instead of white. Her official biography listed her as the first Native American professor at Penn Law, and the first ""woman of color"" at Harvard Law. She even contributed to a Native American cookbook. A few days ago, she released a genetic test that demonstrates that she is at most 1/64th Native American.Argument:The most obvious form of racism is that of someone like Donald Trump. It's the alt-right Republican who claims that ""Obama was not born in the US"" or defends against accusations with phrases like ""Islam is not a race.""Elizabeth Warren's words and actions are emblematic of a subtle, but also vile form of ""progressive"" racism. I don't mean the ignorant claims of ""reverse racism"" spouted by white nationalists. I mean the kind of racism that uses the enforced hardships of racial and ethnic minorities in the US to propel one's own selfish ends. This is a strange concept for most white liberal people to think about, but fortunately, one of the best movies from last year explains it perfectly. This idea of ""liberal racism"" is the theme of Get Out. Here is how a Guardian article frames the issue (spoiler alert).The villains here aren’t southern rednecks or neo-Nazi skinheads, or the so-called “alt-right”. They’re middle-class white liberals. The kind of people who read this website. The kind of people who shop at Trader Joe’s, donate to the ACLU and would have voted for Obama a third time if they could. Good people. Nice people. Your parents, probably. The thing Get Out does so well – and the thing that will rankle with some viewers – is to show how, however unintentionally, these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people. It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester. It’s an attitude, an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution, but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous.I believe that Elizabeth Warren has done the same thing as the villains in that film. She has claimed Native American ancestry to frame herself as a victim. This victim status allows her to present herself with a ""rags to riches"" all-American success story. As another example of this idea, consider this clip from South Park. I think the entire thing is one step above Rachel Dolezal.The way she presented it hasn't convinced any Native Americans. She hasn't met with tribal leaders or done anything to show she cares about that group during her time in office. She has used them as a prop. Her goal was never to court their votes. Her goal was to appeal to white progressives like herself. It's the same way that Donald Trump talks about violence in Chicago and asks black people what they have to lose by voting for him, since Democratic policies have supposedly failed them. It's not a genuine attempt to win black voters. It's a way to win white conservatives who want reassurance he's not a racist.Nuances:I believe that even the best spun version of this story demonstrates a complete lack of integrity on Warren's part. It was wrong even if she didn't receive special considerations in her career. It was wrong even if there was some arbitrary in-law issues between her parents' families. It was wrong, even if she never technically claimed to be a card carrying Cherokee. Some opinion articles (mostly written by white progressives) are framing this as a mistake where Warren simply screwed up by trying to fight back against Trump. I think Trump is irrelevant. This issue exists in a vacuum outside of the current political climate. She made her bed decades ago, and has kept up the charade even today. Usually I'd assume ignorance over malice, but this is especially disappointing because Warren has positioned herself as a progressive who knows better. This revelation about her thought process calls into question many other details about her life. For example, she claims she grew up at the lower edge of middle class. Is that another white lie to better frame her rags to riches story?Note, I'm not disputing her accomplishments and the challenges she overcame to achieve them. Also, I freely admit that being a professional woman in the late 60s onward was a challenging experience. That being said, being a white middle class child in America in the 1950s was an incredible privilege that even white middle class people today can't relate to. Given that Europe was still recovering from WWII, and newly independant, but formerly colonized countries like India, Pakistan, China, etc. were dealing with widespread poverty and hunger, the middle class in the US was able to achieve incredible wealth (easily enough to be in the global 1% at the time). To put it another way, for decades, the SAT was written and refined to capture the writing style of middle class white American people like Warren.I find the entire concept of ""racial purity testing"" to be ""problematic."" This has several implications. First, I think Warren screwed up by using the 21st century version of this kind of test. But more importantly, I dispute the one-drop rule, where one-drop of sub-Saharan African blood meant a person was black. I dispute it on principle, but I also dispute it in the way Elizabeth Warren has claimed it applies to her. I believe she has lived a life complete with all the trappings of a white middle class American lifestyle. I don't think she personally faced any challenges that come with being a member of a marginalized racial minority group. I don't anyone would have even thought about it for a moment or associated her with it if she hadn't brought it up herself. She has inverted this despicable vestige of old school American racism and used it for personal and political (if not financial) gain without once facing the challenges associated with that status.As a final point, I despise Donald Trump. I frequently criticize Republicans for turning a blind eye to his crimes in pursuit of ""winning."" I think Democrats owe the same critical eye to Elizabeth Warren, who is the leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 nomination. If Warren issues a heartfelt apology, clarifies a detail that invalidates my argument, or otherwise moves past this issue in a satisfactory way, that's great. Otherwise, I think it's the responsibility of anyone who cares about social justice in any meaningful way beyond lip service to support other candidates in the 2020 primary.","['DeltaBot', 'Indon_Dasani', 'McKoijion', 'Indon_Dasani', 'McKoijion', 'Indon_Dasani', 'McKoijion', 'EmotionallySqueezed', 'McKoijion', 'Indon_Dasani', 'Gnometard', 'McKoijion', 'MutoidDad', 'McKoijion', 'MutoidDad', 'McKoijion', 'MutoidDad', 'noisewar', 'McKoijion', 'noisewar', 'McKoijion', 'noisewar', 'McKoijion', 'noisewar', 'McKoijion', 'MercurianAspirations', 'McKoijion', 'MercurianAspirations', 'McKoijion', 'MercurianAspirations', 'McKoijion', 'yardaper', 'McKoijion', 'theoriginalj', 'drewskki1', 'McKoijion', 'MercurianAspirations', 'UNisopod', 'impresaria', 'McKoijion', 'hacksoncode', 'McKoijion', 'DeltaBot', 'humanist_devolved', 'fakenate35', 'WickedCunnin', 'McKoijion', 'koolex', 'gadgetcool5', 'McKoijion', 'dftba8497', 'Hartastic', 'gadgetcool5', 'McKoijion', 'miguelguajiro', 'McKoijion', 'drewskki1', 'McKoijion', 'drewskki1', 'McKoijion', 'drewskki1', 'gadgetcool5', 'AFreebornManoftheUSA', 'NicolasName', 'john_gee', 'McKoijion', 'GlyphGryph', 'McKoijion', 'GlyphGryph', 'justaguy394', 'makemeking706', 'JasonDJ', 'McKoijion', '10ebbor10', 'McKoijion', '10ebbor10', 'McKoijion', 'pananana1', 'McKoijion', 'MonkeyPlug', 'McKoijion', 'OCedHrt', 'notshinx', 'McKoijion', 'notshinx', 'McKoijion', 'OCedHrt', 'YourFairyGodmother', 'McKoijion', 'YourFairyGodmother', 'WickedCunnin', 'McKoijion', 'jonhwoods', 'McKoijion', 'Turius_', 'McKoijion', 'Turius_', 'McKoijion', 'DeltaBot', 'kevingharvey', 'McKoijion', 'kevingharvey', 'McKoijion', 'kevingharvey', 'kevingharvey', 'triumph900', 'McKoijion', 'YoungHeartsAmerica', 'McKoijion', 'hacksoncode', 'McKoijion', 'atred', 'McKoijion', 'atred', 'McKoijion', 'atred', 'McKoijion', 'howHardIsIt2SignUp', 'shortadamlewis', 'jennysequa', 'McKoijion', 'CodeUmbra', 'atypicalphilosopher', 'drewskki1', 'McKoijion', 'McKoijion', 'McKoijion', 'beeleigha', 'GnosticGnome', 'McKoijion', 'GnosticGnome', 'McKoijion', 'GnosticGnome', 'ReverendHerby', 'radicalbulldog', 'McKoijion', 'radicalbulldog', 'McKoijion', 'McKoijion', 'beeleigha', 'HomunculusEmeritus', 'hmore6251', 'McKoijion', 'pigeonwiggle', 'McKoijion', 'pigeonwiggle', 'McKoijion', 'mao_intheshower', 'McKoijion', 'CodeUmbra', 'hmore6251', 'McKoijion', 'Chickens1', 'McKoijion', 'AFlaccoSeagulls', 'McKoijion', 'ConsentManufacturer', 'McKoijion', 'rainyfox', 'So-_-It-_-Goes', 'McKoijion', 'slo1111', 'McKoijion', 'mysundayscheming', 'ProfessorLexis', 'McKoijion', 'ProfessorLexis', 'McKoijion', 'garnteller', 'orthopod', 'radicalbulldog', 'Atikon_is_back', 'griffonsrule', 'rushingshill', 'supermodel-robot', 'McKoijion', 'supermodel-robot', 'TezzMuffins', 'Steakasaurus', 'crymorenoobs', 'Futchkuk', 'McKoijion', 'Futchkuk', 'McKoijion', 'Aaberg321', 'TechnoL33T', 'McKoijion', 'TechnoL33T']","[""/u/McKoijion (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""The concept of tribal identification as being based on 'blood' or genetics is something imposed on American tribes by lawmakers, not necessarily reflective of native american culture.\n"", 'I agree with that.

Unfortunately, listing yourself as a minority even though you aren't is exactly the kind of insidious racism I'm describing in this post. It's the same as how the villains acted in Get Out. Obviously, the big difference is that they were torturing/imprisoning people while Warren is not. But stripped of the violence, they have the same mentality towards racial minorities that I believe Warren does.\n\n"", 'I think you\'re going to have to find some evidence of Warren actually framing herself as a victim in order for your viewpoint to make sense. As far as I know, Warren never actually tried to use her ancestry to get any benefits. Yes, she represented herself a certain way when sharing her perspective, because what she was taught about her ancestry informed that perspective. But everyone has a unique perspective informed by their heritage. She wasn\'t ""using"" her family history in anyway differently than everybody else. \n', 'I don\'t think that Warren had to definitively present herself as a victim in an interview or job application. Simply checking the Native American box was enough. Even if she didn\'t personally profit, I think this was ethically wrong.\nThat being said, this is just speculation, but I don\'t trust Harvard\'s response that race didn\'t play a factor in her career at all. Mindy Kaling\'s brother faked being black to get into medical school. The school he attended later said: \n\nHis MCAT scores and science grade point average met SLU\'s criteria for admission at that time, and his race or ethnicity did not factor into his acceptance into the University\n\nThis response is similar to Harvard\'s response today. I think Kaling\'s brother\'s GPA and MCAT score were far below what most Indian-American students at the time needed to achieve. It technically hit the minimum standard, but its similar to the way $10 is technically enough to buy tickets to Hamilton.\nEveryone has a unique perspective informed by their heritage. Most of these are benign, but Warren made one of the few claims that could potentially create a material benefit for her career. Society tolerated affirmative action because the net benefit outweighed the net negative. On the upside, it leveled the playing field for racial and ethnic minorities who were playing with a discrimination based handicap. A black man who is able to achieve a 1400/1600 on the SAT despite racial discrimination would probably have gotten a 1500 without it. The cost to this is that it squeezed out people who actually achieved a 1500 on the SAT, even Asian-Americans who are also playing with a handicap. \nToday, Harvard is being sued for racial discrimination. Affirmative action is facing more scrutiny than ever before. If affirmative action is ended, it is likely to result in racial and ethnic minorities facing even more challenges. To see someone like Elizabeth Warren tacitly get some of the benefits of being a ""woman of color"" without facing any of the challenges is insulting. I don\'t think her ""unique perspective informed by their heritage"" justifies it.\nAgain, this is all speculation about how people at Harvard treated her. Either they used her as a prop to claim that they were falsely diversifying, or she did it herself. But even if it was all some low level Harvard publicist\'s fault and Warren never actually got any benefits, it was still an incredibly inappropriate thing to do, in my opinion.\n', ""In your thinking, which white people should be permitted to talk about their family history? If it is unethical for some white people to mention their family history, is it unethical for all white people? I don't think that mentioning that my father is an immigrant will garner any benefits - but should I purposefully withhold this information on the off chance that somebody will choose to benefit me because of it?\n"", 'I think all white people should be able to talk about their family history in all circumstances. I don\'t think white people should list themselves as a different race on an official form. \nThere are material benefits to listing oneself as a member of a disadvantaged minority group. They are vastly outweighed by the disadvantages though. We as a society have implemented a ""weighting system"" to level the playing field. \nIf a white person lists themselves as a racial minority, they get all the advantages without any of the disadvantages. They are taking advantage of the racial minorities sure, but they are also taking advantage of white people who went to slightly less prestigious colleges or got slightly lower paying jobs because of this system. It\'s like a millionaire doing their grocery shopping at a food pantry.\nOn that last point, I have a very low bar for what it means to be disadvantaged. I think no one should be turned away from a food pantry, even if they seem too rich to be there. In the same way, I\'m willing to put up with an affirmative action system that unfairly benefits rich, privileged people who happen to be black on the off chance it actually helps a person who is actually disadvantaged due to race. But Warren has stretched the limits of that social contract. I don\'t think she has even the slightest claim to calling herself a Native American, and it\'s an insult to every racial and ethnic minority and an insult to every white person as well.\n', ""\nwhite people should list themselves as a different race on an official form\n\nAccording to the boston globe this is not what happened. Warren changed her identifier on that form in '89, three years after she was hired at Penn. You can clearly see the entry on that form as changing from 'C' to 'A'. The article also states that of the surviving people involved in hiring her at Harvard, many were unaware of her ancestry claim and all but one said that it wasn't discussed when hiring her. \nBut moreover - Warren decided to fill out that form that way because she believed it to be true. It was true in the sense that that was what her family brought her up believing. And also true in the sense that she does have some genetic lineage that is provably native American. \nBut back to your argument - white people should never misrepresent themselves on official forms. But your verdict here of misrepresentation is based solely on your judgement of what race she is based on her skin color. You're making an external judgement that conflicts with not only what she was taught about her family heritage and culture, and you expect her to conform to your judgement over her own? \nUltimately for your argument to make sense we have to agree that privilege has everything to do with skin color and nothing to do with family history. That diversity really is just about having different colored people and isn't about having people with different perspectives. That skin color is the only factor that should ever be considered. I can't abide by that. Diversity is about more than just melanin. \n"", 'I think there are two ways to claim heritage: nature and nurture.\nNature: Baby is born to black parents, and is adopted by a wealthy white family.

Even though they don\'t have any ""black DNA"", they have a cultural roots to base their claim off of.\nI don\'t think that Warren\'s white middle class roots give her the nurture claim, and I don\'t think her genetic testing gives her the nature claim. I don\'t believe her account of the challenges her parents faced from their in-laws is enough to back up a claim to being Native American. In this way, my argument against her Native American claim goes far beyond skin color.\nAs for the concept of whether people knew of her ancestry, a big part of the existence of racial minority status is that racial minorities don\'t get to choose. You are black because you are told you are black by others. Elizabeth Warren was able to change her race simply by checking a box. She had the privilege of self-identifying her own race, not having it forced upon her. Everyone else continued to treat her with the privileges of being white. She enjoyed the benefits of both types of status, and few of the disadvantages. She, in a sense, got to have her cake and eat it too.\n', 'I think this illustrates the crux of your problem.   You are unclear whether black (or Native American) is a culture or a race.  And you’re using either characterization when it is convenient for you.

Their grandparents?   Is it a percentage of their lineage?  Is it where they grew up?   You’re drawing a line for Elizabeth Warren, but you haven’t clearly defined that line.

I'm saying that in the aggregate, Native Americans get special privileges to level the playing field. This imbalance is the result of genocide in the past, and continued discrimination today.

The more people recognize their mixed race heritage, the more we\'ll realize strict dividing lines by race are bullshit. That will lessen racism overall.\n\nShe has inverted this despicable vestige of old school American racism and used it for personal and political (if not financial) gain without once facing the challenges associated with that status.\n\nThere is no evidence she has gained personally or politically from any of this, or that she ever intended to. \n\nOtherwise, I think it\'s the responsibility of anyone who cares about social justice in any meaningful way beyond lip service to support other candidates in the 2020 primary.\n\nEven if you maintain your view on all of the above, you can\'t state this last line unless you show that the other candidates don\'t have problems in themselves, which many of them do.\n', '\nHow is growing up as a middle class white woman in the 1950s incredibly privileged? \n\nI\'m not denying that she faced challenges in her life, overcame obstacles, and achieved a high degree of success.

But I do think she has had a far more privileged background than most people on earth, especially members of the group she claimed to be part of.\n\nIs there any evidence she has used her Native American ancestry to present herself with a ""rags to riches"" story? It seems to me that she has such a story, but it has nothing to do with being Native American, nor did she ever claim to be one.\n\nIf she had stuck to the true details of her life, it would be fine. Overcoming the economic challenges and those associated with being a woman are compelling enough on her own. But she chose to list herself as a Native American in the 1980s and 1990s, which is a racial group she does not belong to. If she misled people in this way, I think she may be misleading people about other aspects of her life too.\nYou could argue that she clarified when asked, but I think that\'s like if someone puts on a cast even though their arm isn\'t broken. They would tell the truth if they were asked directly, but no one would ever ask. I personally wouldn\'t want to be the person who accuses someone of lying about the race they checked on a form.\n\nWell she did call out Trump on refusing to give a $1 million donation to a Native American charity.\n\nTrump is a horrible person, but that is irrelevant here. This is about Warren\'s character. It\'s about something she did decades ago, and something she is still using today for political gain. Simply tweeting out that DNA test this week is an example of how she is using her false claim to gain political points. \n\nShe also, as u/miguelguajiro2 pointed out, has cosponsored bills for Native Americans, which you dismissed because she was the cosponsor and not the original sponsor... but you said she hasn\'t done ""anything"" and she certainly has done something. That\'s a factual claim which has now been debunked on multiple fronts.)\n\nAs for the Native American related bills she has cosponsored, I don\'t think she has shown the level of enthusiasm for tribal affairs that I would expect from a member of that racial group. I think she has done a great job representing her community by sponsoring hundreds of bills that benefit white middle and working class progressives. But the reason I think she hasn\'t pushed laws that help Native Americans is because she is not a member of that community. There is nothing inherently wrong with doing this in a representative democracy, but it does reinforce the idea that she is not a member of that community.\n\nYou keep saying this but you don\'t say why, except that she used it for a rags-to-riches story: But there\'s no evidence that she did.\n\nI agree there is no evidence, but I have a suspicion that she did get direct material benefit in her career. But even if she didn\'t then, she is using it to garner political support today. That was the whole point of the tweet from earlier this week.\nMore importantly, I think doing this is wrong, even if you don\'t gain any direct material benefit. We as a society have accepted an idea of actively leveling the playing field for groups that are discriminated against. Affirmative action is an example. Black people have been traditionally and are still marginalized by American society. As such, we take those additional burdens into account when admitting black people into college or hiring for a job. The idea is that if a black person who is also facing discrimination every day gets a 1400 on the SAT, they would have gotten a 1500 without that discrimination. In this way, there is a small benefit that comes with all the major disadvantages of being in a marginalized racial or ethnic group.\nElizabeth Warren, by making herself as a Native American in the 80s and 90s got to experience the benefits of being white and a member of an oppressed racial group, but none of the benefits. She harmed Native Americans, sure, but she also took advantage of white people who get lower opportunities in life as a result of this system. Even if she got just one extra vote or a tiny amount of leeway in her job because she was a ""woman of color"", she has taken advantage of everyone else in America. \n\nWhite middle class people today make more than white middle class people in the 1950s. \n\nYes, in absolute terms, everyone makes more money today than in years past. But a middle class white American person was significantly wealthier than almost everyone else around the world in the 1950s. Today, middle class white Americans do not have that same level of luxury. It\'s why a high school education was enough for a single earner household to get a high paying job, a house, two cars, a college education for their kids, etc. There was no competition from any other country. Today, white middle class Americans face competition from all sides.\n\nAnd as I said, being a woman in the 1950s was a very oppressive time no matter what race you were born into. \n\nI still completely agree with you, and I\'ll add that being a woman is incredibly challenging in a developed country today. But this argument is just about her claims to being a Native American. I\'ll add in that I think it was more challenging on average to be a Native American woman over the past few decades than a white woman at the same time.\n\nFurther, Trump\'s privilege is far greater than Warren\'s, since he was the son of a multimillion-dollar real estate developer in New York City, and a man to boot.\n\nYes, I completely agree Trump is far more privileged, dodged far more taxes, screwed over a lot more innocent people, etc. I\'ll say I think he is one of the worst humans alive today. But I\'m not really interested in ""whataboutism"" in this argument. It\'s just about Warren.\n\nI don\'t think this should be a rule, but if mostly white people want to identify with their mixed-race heritage, I see that as a good thing, not a bad thing. The more people recognize their mixed race heritage, the more we\'ll realize strict dividing lines by race are bullshit. That will lessen racism overall.\n\nI agree with that too. If Warren had simply written a speech or book about this, it would be great. But Warren listed herself as a Native American in the 80s and 90s, which was a time when doing so granted major advantages that were denied to others. If we decide to eliminate those racial advantages, then there is nothing wrong with making claims to a given race. For example, if someone claims they are part Irish, that\'s great because there is no advantage to being Irish. If a person claims they are part Jewish, that\'s great. If a person claims they are part Jewish (even though they aren\'t) at a time when they are eligible for Birthright, it\'s wrong. They are getting a free trip to Israel, donated by other Jews trying to preserve their culture, under misleading pretenses.\n\nThere is no evidence she has gained personally or politically from any of this, or that she ever intended to.\n\nThis tweet alone is evidence of how she is using this idea for personal gain. I think it backfired, but it\'s still an attempt at using already problematic idea of DNA testing for race to score political points.\n\nEven if you maintain your view on all of the above, you can\'t state this last line unless you show that the other candidates don\'t have problems in themselves, which many of them do.\n\nThere are hundreds of millions of American citizens who vote for Democrats. Any one of them could potentially be a great candidate. There are 20 or so likely candidates, but if all of them have problems like this, we don\'t have to settle for any of them.\n', 'A few things I would question:\n1) How much of Warren\'s framing of her upbringing as ""being on the edge"" of middle class has anything to do with whether or not she is part-Native American. We don\'t have any reason to doubt her stories about repossessed cars, medical bills from her father\'s health condition, etc... The truth is that you\'re not going to find a lot of people from Oklahoma at elite Northeastern Colleges, and the ones that do end up there are usually wealthy people whose parents were there to work in oil or something like that. That she is a woman, who dropped out to get married, etc all are things that make her story all the more exceptional and having nothing to do with being American.\n2) I haven\'t really seen any evidence that she presented herself as Native American to portray herself as a victim. If she was part Native American, and had never spoken a word about it, couldn\'t we see that of evidence of her wanting to deny her ancestry in order to better fit in her new elite circles? Keep in mind a lot has changed over the years, so back when she originally identified as NA, it wasn\'t necessarily so celebrated to belong to a minority group. This could just as easily be seen as Native American pride.\n3) LOTS of Americans have hazy claims about Native American ancestry. I have a friend who is obsessed with Eastern Band Cherokee culture. Spend a lot of time in Qualla Boundary, learned some of the language etc because he thought for 50 years it was his ancestry, based on visiting his grandmother as a child whose house was filled with Cherokee artifacts. Turned out she just liked them. My guess is that closer you are to Oklahoma, which has a relatively large NA population, the more people who will believe they are part Native American with no proof.\n4) Warren has worked on behalf of Native Americans in her role as a senator. https://www.congress.gov/member/elizabeth-warren/W000817?q=%7B%22subject%22%3A%22Native+Americans%22%7D\n\u200b\nAll that said, I do think there is some push within liberal circles, or in universities, for students to find a way to identify with a marginalized group, and it probably results in people really searching to make some connection (i.e, my grandmother was an immigrant from Ireland so I understand refugees) in a way that ends up being insulting to people who really do belong to marginalized groups.\n', ""\nYes, she has achieved a lot in her life and faced many challenges. I don't think that this story discredits those aspects, unless she has misled people about them in a similar fashion (which I don't think she has).\nI don't think she needed to present herself as a victim in a hiring process just like a black college applicant needs to write a story about facial racial discrimination. Simply checking the box implies it. It's like putting on a cast even though you don't have a broken bone. It implies you do have a broken bone.

In the same way, if Warren hadn't released her own genetic record herself, I would never have assumed this was a false claim. \nBut most Americans don't list themselves as Native American.\nI don't find those bills convincing. First, she wasn't the sponsor on any of them. She was a cosponsor on all of them often along with 20 other senators. Only one of them made it into law. So if one side of the coin is writing the bill yourself, getting cosponsors, cutting deals, and making legislative sacrifices to get a bill passed, Elizabeth Warren agreed to get pizza when someone else asked, and then didn't particularly protest when the plans fell through.\n\n"", 'You keep saying that checking the Native American box implies she struggled.

There was plausible Warren family lore, as there is in many Oklahoman families, about a Cherokee ancestor, which included a memory of in-law bigotry against Warren’s mother for her supposed Cherokee and Delaware blood. At some point in Warren’s academic career, this lore became part of her official biography, so that she was listed as a “Native American” professor at the University of Pennsylvania and described as Harvard Law’s “first woman of color,” and she even contributed a family recipe to a Native American cookbook.\n\nAs I understand it, Elizabeth Warren\'s position is that it was a low level Harvard publicist who made a mistake by touting her as an example of Harvard Law\'s diversity (despite it officially being listed as her race at the university), and she had no idea she was being described this way.\n', ""Yeah, you worded that in a misleading way.

Elizabeth Warren listed her race as Native American on official forms, then a low level publicist read that form and said she was a woman of color in an interview.

In doing so, he's discovered that we are direct descendents of Davy Crockett.  The fact that that was 8 or so generations ago does not make me any less of a descendent of him. In the United States, with Native American being a legal term, membership is derived from ancestry based on the condition that one is a direct descendent of a Native American. Since there is no longer any question that she is indeed a direct descendent, it can reasonably said that Elizabeth Warren is, as classified by the federal government, a Native American and member of the Cherokee tribe.

It\'s like if you inherit a priceless diamond ring, and act like you are super rich, only for it to turn out that it\'s a fake ring.

I don\'t think the low level Harvard staffer did anything wrong because she read it off of Warren\'s official listing. I don\'t think it was her responsibility to go to Warren and ask her to justify her race. The person who was responsible was Warren herself for listing her race as Native American in the first place. Furthermore, when she was confronted about it in the mid-90s, she didn\'t correct the record right away. She first defensively doubled down.\nThis is my understanding of what happened here.

If she always thought it was some distant ancestor (i.e., not a recent one), then I think it\'s a hard pill to swallow. Someone else made a claim that the rules are different in Oklahoma, and that people who are only a small fraction Native American are considered Native American. That\'s another way I would give Warren the benefit of the doubt. But I\'m skeptical.\n\nWhat has she done in the way of self-aggrandizement as a Native American? Nothing that that I can think of. She was almost entirely mum on the subject. The only reason it\'s a thing is because Scott Brown, her opponent for the Senate seat, made a big deal about it.\n\nFirst, from a cynical perspective, I think it makes sense to claim to be Native American as a University of Texas law professor in the 80s and 90s. It might help, and there is little risk involved. The only way it becomes an issue is if you run for politics and it comes out. It\'s the same way that Trump used his charitable foundation to dodge taxes. It\'s very hard to catch unless you piss everyone in the country off and people are (rightfully) looking for every reason to indict you.\nIn this way, it also makes sense that Warren covered it up as best she could. As I understand it, she tried to defensively defend herself in the mid-90s, which must have been a scarring experience.\nAs for whether she has ever used this for political ends, she used this idea to try to score political points just two days ago.\n\nThose are the facts. If the facts don\'t change your mind, I\'ll surmise that you\'re not really open to changing your view.\n\nI think I\'ve addressed your facts and opinions. I\'m happy to change my view, and I\'ve listed a few ways that I would change it. To put this into perspective, if Warren wins the Democratic nominee, I\'m going to vote for her regardless.

It would be ""doubling down"" only if she was knowingly engaging in deception, or if she had reason to doubt that what her family - parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles -  had told her many times was true.  Unless the family stories one grows up with are of exceptional nature, you accept them as true.  Why would she question the unremarkable stories she had repeatedly heard? Put yourself in her shoes - what you think in that situation?   So no, she didn\'t double down, she just restated what she honestly believed to be true.  \nFrom a Boston Globe article when Scott Brown was making a big deal about it: \n\nWarren’s brothers, Don, John, and David Herring, also issued a joint statement supporting their sister. “The people attacking Betsy and our family don’t know much about either. We grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family’s Cherokee and Delaware heritage. They’ve passed away now, but they’d be angry if they were around today listening to all this.”\n\nSo no, she didn\'t ""double down.""  There was never any deception on her part.  \n\nIf she always thought it was some distant ancestor (i.e., not a recent one), then I think it\'s a hard pill to swallow. \n\nShe likely didn\'t think about it in that way at all.  Read once more what her brothers said : ""We grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family’s Cherokee and Delaware heritage.""  They most probably did not set out an exact lineage. They didn\'t say things like ""your grandfather Joe was 1/2 Cherokee and 1/4 Delaware"" or such. Because they didn\'t actually know.  They too were just handing down family lore. Which turns out to be bogus but they did not know that.  \n\nFirst, from a cynical perspective, I think it makes sense to claim to be Native American as a University of Texas law professor in the 80s and 90s. It might help, and there is little risk involved. The only way it becomes an issue is if you run for politics and it comes out. \n\nThere\'s SO much presupposition there. You\'re imputing motive purely from your own bias.  What that says is you\'ve already decided that she did something deceptive, for personal gain.  You\'re the one that\'s doubling down.  You\'ve already already found her guilty - that paragraph is all about rationalizing your already set conclusion.  Putting what you said in other words, ""well this is why she would have lied and this is why I believe she did in fact lie.""  That would never fly in a courtroom, which this isn\'t of course, but one should never rationalize suppositional guilt instead of determining guilt from the preceding facts.  \nThe only way it becomes an issue is if you run for politics and it  turns out what you always thought to be the case wasn\'t, because  your family unknowingly misled you.   \n\nIt\'s the same way that Trump used his charitable foundation to dodge taxes. \n\nNot the same at all and once again shows that you are set in your conviction that she deliberately deceived ... whoever.   Trump knowingly used it to dodge taxes, specifically and solely for personal gain.   It would be the same thing only if Warren knowingly lied or misled, and for personal gain.  Which you have decided to be the case,  contrary to all the evidence. \n\nIt\'s very hard to catch unless you piss everyone in the country off and people are (rightfully) looking for every reason to indict you.  \n\nAnd if she wasn\'t trying to get away with anything? If she didn\'t think there was anything to catch?  \n\nAs I understand it, she tried to defensively defend herself in the mid-90s, \n\nWhat ""defensively defend herself"" means I do not know.  I suspect   you mean she was overly defensive, implying guilt.  Is that it?  Well that\'s yet one more case of rationalizing your forgone conclusion.  What I do know is that making any conclusion aboutanything based on ""as I understand it"" is not a good way to go about things.  \n\nshe used this idea to try to score political points just two days ago.\n\nOh?

This is all what I have been told so I have no idea how accurate it is.\nI can only guess that Elizabeth Warren was told similar stories by her family growing up in OKC and I know many people here who grew up thinking they possessed a high percentage of Native American blood only to be proven they have less than they thought after some (especially recently with Ancestry.com and DNA) digging into their family heritage. I guess I'm a bit sympathetic to her because her story growing up is similar to my own. I grew up middle class. Sometimes my family had money and other times we had to scrap and claw to get by, but if I was a politician and told people that story, I would have people slamming me because I grew up in a nice neighborhood and attended private school.\nHope my perspective helps.

I also can't trust myself to gauge the validity of anyone else's bar. What I can say is this: I don't think Warren had any ill intent when she made the claim. I think this was evidenced by the fact that she took the test to begin with. She was told something by people she trusted and she believed it. I can understand this, because before I decided to take a DNA test, I was told that I was half Italian. My father was supposedly half Italian, and my mother was supposedly half Italian. Turns out, if either side of my parents' families have any Italian, it's represented by that 2 percent broadly European. Just 2 percent. That's it! And yet, if I told them this, especially my father's side, who still eat pasta for Thanksgiving, I don't think anything about their identity would change. And so, I don't disagree with you at all about any bars that should be set to determine Warren's biological heritage, I do think her point of view is understandable. She was told something that was untrue her entire life by someone she loved who also probably believed it. I doubt her identity is going to change much as a result of learning that the truth is not as hearty as she was lead to believe, and I'd be hard pressed to blame her for that. \n"", 'In your Italian food example, it seems your family has a strong association with Italian culture.

She's actually trying to use her privilege for good, even if she is carrying a few misconceptions along with her.

They were forced to act white, and spent their lives doing their best to pass as white.  Their children, and grandchildren, and great grandchildren grew up surrounded by white culture, and never knew anything about their heritage.\nGiven that, is it worse to keep up the lie and pretend that ancestor was never stolen away and forced to live a lie?  As if having native blood is a shameful secret to keep hidden away?  Or is it worse to claim that heritage openly, when it is so diluted so as to be almost invisible, and not a trace of shared culture remains?\nI have never contacted the tribe I am descended from.  There is a part of me that wants to knock on the door and say, “Your child was stolen from you.  I can not return them, but they are not gone in full; I am here, and they are a part of me. By coming here, I return them to you, that your family - our family-  can be made whole.”    But there is another part of me that winces at all the thought.  Beyond a few words, what would my appearance do besides opening old wounds?  What benefit could I offer?  Would it look like I was looking for a handout, or condescendingly offering one?  And yet continuing to hide it like my Native ancestor always did seems so inherently evil.\nWarren’s route seems like the most ethical and morally upstanding.  Claim the ancestry openly and proudly, but don’t claim tribal citizenship.  \nThat said, I’m hesitant to say anything without talking to the tribe first, in case there is a major issue surrounding it that I’m simply not aware of.  And I’m not going to contact the tribe without permission from my other relatives, and it’s an awkward question to bring up.  It’s not that I feel the cultures I currently identify with are lacking and I need something more, and it’s not that I think I’m lying if I don’t mark down that Native American ancestry on forms .

I do have a problem where someone who isn't a member of a given race and hasn't experienced any of the challenges they face, claims they are a member to access the benefits.\nSay 10,000 people donate to a food bank. Everyone is slightly less wealthy to help a handful of people get enough to eat. I would never question if someone is poor enough to go there, and I would never turn anyone away.

Why does it matter that someone wants to identify as a certain race? \nOn some level it is because you are witnessing a person receive credit for something they do not deserve or own. But that feeling requires me to quantify why Warren does not deserve to identify with a race of her choosing. Therefore I then become a part of the problem. I start picking a choosing different aspects of the person that should or should not qualify them to identify as a particular race. \nMy point is, this sort of thinking is toxic and only deepens the divide between respective races of people.

Then from 1986 to 1994, she checked the Native American box and was classified as a minority law teacher by the Association of American Law Schools, which is the time frame she went from the University of Texas to Penn to Harvard.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with that, especially since there’s no evidence she’s ever used that to get benefits or play a victim in any situation.\n\nShe just used it to try to win political points two days ago.\n\nSo, I wholeheartedly disagree with the assertion that this entire thing is some villainous ploy to be racist.\n\nI'm not sure if she did it on purpose or even thinks it's wrong. I think it's just like the plot of Get Out (spoiler alert) where the villains didn't choose black people because they hated them. They did it because they wanted to associate with black culture, and had no problem using them to their advantage.\n"", '\nShe grew up as a middle class white woman in the United States in the 1950s.\n\nI take umbrage with this. Perhaps relatively she was privileged, but women were and are still struggling. Particularly in that era in that part of the country.\n', 'Yes, I completely agree. Women have faced a long history of hardships, and continue to face sexism today. But she still had far more opportunities than a middle class Native American woman.\n', 'Okay, first let us begin by considering what is meant by racism, utilising an online definition as ""an action or set of actions directed against someone of another race based upon there own belief that there race is superior"". For the sake of argument let us suggest that Warren falsely chose to represent her race (I will discuss the problem with this assumption in a later parapgraph).\nI don\'t believe you have clearly demonstrated that Warren actions were driven by the hatred or predujice to another group based upone race, you have utilised examples of hate groups acting as victims, however filling in university forms and a cook book doesn\'t seem to be a comparable example. \nThis doesn\'t suggest that the action taken by Warren are morally wrong or right, but utilising the concept of racism to address them seems flawed, so start with a simpler statement, for example consider this simpler statement, Warren should not utilise a race she does not belong to for personal benefit?\nNow let us address this statement, how do you declare what someones race is. Utilising skin colour would be horiffically racist, let us take the example of black british people travelling in America who are often misidentified as African American. Or consider children of mixed marriages, they may not inherit any of there common racial characteristics or even genetics as you only inherit a portion of each of your ancenstors genetics. Or a further example of somone who has lived in another country there entire life, yet originate from another country, there is no definite line, there is no exact point, race is fluid evolving, defining it based upon genetics or other factors is impossible, it is in the end a social construct utilised to draw in people and create groups, nothing more and nothing less. \nThus you now have to proove that Warren lied from her perspective on those forms, she has stated that her family told her stories of native american ancenstory, which she may have believed, is it possible that she utilised this as an advantage while applying for one of the most competitive law schools in the world, well yes, but that also doesn\'t mean it is false. And really are you telling me that in every cv and application you don\'t utilise every single plausible truth that you have in order to maximise your probability of getting a job. \nFinally you have to consider the context of the genetic test, it was taken only after she was directly insulted by Donald Trump, stating that she was lying about her heritage, what other actions can she carry out in this case, considering this is the man she is running against in 2020 (most likely), is she simply meant to ignore him, endless reporting over and over again, as he is bound to. Or can she utilise this test which demonstrates that at one point she had ancenstors who were  Native americans, as a tool against a man who will lie constantly, state false news. What were her other options in this scenario? Stand down? Say nothing? Don\'t people need to stand up to Trump with every piece of information, every piece of facts as otherwise 2020 may be a repeat of 2016.   \nBut in the end is this the major marker of her character, should she not be judged on the rest of her life, on her policies, on her stated beliefs, in the end it is your right to judge what you deem important within your politicians, I would be interested as why this would be a major focus of yours.\nIn summary, I don\'t think you have demonstrated a clear link to racism or have clearly shown that Warren did lie about her race and moreover in my opinion there are far more important factors in supporting a politican, such as there policies and past legeslative work and voting patterns.  \n', 'First, none of the claims you make appear to have valid sources. There is ambiguity with a few, in terms of who made decisions to call her things and outright denial by all parties for others. \nSecond, the aspects of what she did that are not in dispute, to me, show a pride in her heritage rather then taking advantage of the situation. \nWould it not be more disrespectful for her to ignore her families traditions? \n', ""\nFirst, none of the claims you make appear to have valid sources.

Supposedly, my maternal great grandfather was a Native American man from South Dakota. Nobody really has much idea of that family line, as many died early in their lives and my grandmother refused to speak about her past much. \nConsidering that I am a ""white mutt"" with ties to at least five countries in Europe who immigrated to the US, what makes this Native American ancestry of mine any more or less valid? Additionally, I wasn\'t raised Swedish or German or French or ect... anymore than I was raised as a Native American.

I don't think it would be ethical for you to list yourself as a Native American on a form that may result in special privileges being given to you at the expense of others. \nFor example, Dartmouth College was founded to be a school for Native Americans (through a colonialist mindset, but still). Since the 1970s, there are numerous special privileges for Native Americans who apply there such as free tuition and more attainable educational standards.

I don\'t know you, so I can\'t fairly do that. But neither can you.\nWe are becoming increasingly obsessive over the question of what other people believe, and why they believe what they do. \nWe convince ourselves that our opinions are widely shared, and we are shocked when we find out otherwise. We obsess over opinion polls and approval ratings, upvotes and downvotes, likes and shares, all in an effort to make sure that our opinions continue to attract broad support. When we see people starting to change their minds, we panic. We lash out. We assure ourselves that they must have been deluded, or misinformed, or insecure, or irrational, or maybe they are just a bunch of bigots. \nI\'m not suggesting that opinions don\'t matter. Living under democratic principles, opinions absolutely matter... opinions lead to change, and that change affects everyone. \nWhat I am saying is that we ALL need to stop trying to psychoanalyze each other from afar. That\'s the easy way out... it allows us to ignore what others are saying, to write off entire groups of people, and keep our belief systems intact. \nTo bring this back to your point... the ad hominem attacks you describe come from people who are fearful and angry. Fear and anger are rarely productive responses (without positive channeling), but they are not always irrational. \nThe world is changing quickly, and for many people, that change constitutes a real threat. I\'m not talking about perceived threats, or psychological threats, I\'m talking about change that threatens to leave them tangibly worse off. \nWhile society may decide that, for the good of the whole, these groups of people are going to have to make real concessions, so that all of these groups experience a net gain. That\'s how our society often works. \nThe government\'s resources are scarce. Job opportunities are scarce. College enrollment spots and scholarships are scarce. \nIn order to increase the advancement of women into these positions, similarly-situated men are going to HAVE to be held back, passed over or turned down. That\'s why it is called ""affirmative action""... we are nudging the pieces up and down in order to bring about equality.\nWe justify this on the basis that we are curing the effects of past discrimination. Affirmative action serves to expedite that cure. \nLook at this process from the young man\'s perspective. Young men were born decades after the bloodiest battles of this culture war were fought. The majority of these men were not party to the past discrimination, nor have they ever condoned it. They grew up embracing the message of equality and fairness to all, regardless of identity. And yet, the ""cure"" is being implemented upon them. They are being held back so that the wrongs of the past can be righted.\nThey didn\'t agree to that. They agreed that they wouldn\'t practice or tolerate the bigotry of their forefathers. But they did not agree to bear the consequences of that bigotry. \nThe men who suffer these consequences and voice their anger about it are mocked, ridiculed and deemed to be ""part of the problem."" These criticisms generally come from the very people who benefited from the changes that hurt these young men. That\'s quite a slap in the face. \nSo they lash out. They lash out at women they view as ""feminazis,"" as women they perceive as reveling in the benefits brought by affirmative action, but ignore the costs borne by the men. They also lash out at men they view as ""soy boys"" and ""cucks,"" as men willing to accept ""unfair"" outcomes because they fear reprisal for speaking out (the same reprisal the MGTOW folks do constantly receive). \nAgain... as a society, we\'ve decided that this process has to happen, in order to address past discrimination. But we cannot pretend like the process isn\'t happening, and the groups that benefit from it cannot pretend that they aren\'t, or that the groups bearing the consequences aren\'t. We certainly shouldn\'t heap scorn on those people, especially when they didn\'t create the problem in the first place. \nOn a final note, I want to address the ""insecurity"" element directly, as it relates to masculinity. The truth is, many of these men do indeed feel great uncertainty about what constitutes ""masculinity.""\nOver the past few decades, a lot of effort has gone into ""redefining"" masculinity, and that process is still underway. At this point in time, it isn\'t really clear at all what a man is ""supposed"" to do or be. Culturally, socially, legally... even biologically... the definition of manhood is in flux. \nWe\'ve been tearing down the old definitions of masculinity, but at present, the new definitions are under construction (and under debate). What are the obligations? What are the rules? What does society expect of me? \nWell... that depends on who you listen to. The self-described ""nasty women"" are saying it is OK to hate men and calling on men to just give up, resign and willingly forgo opportunities they otherwise deserve. Are we surprised that, in the face of this message, some men have decided to ""go their own way?"" \nI\'m not saying the ""nasty women"" speak for everyone, or that ""going their own way"" is a productive choice. I point out that instance to demonstrate that the confusion and anxiety felt by the MGTOW crowd comes from a real place. They aren\'t lashing out at ghosts, but at real messages, and real changes. \nI would suggest that these men try to find productive ways to deal with the landscape they face. Unfortunately, it seems like many of the folks they turn to find themselves under assault. Folks like Jordan Peterson gained widespread attention, much of it as the result of the backlash he received for his connection to those young men. A feminist like Camille Paglia is rebranded as ""controversial"" whose past work for ""the cause"" is under new scrutiny, a faces suggestions that she might be part of the problem. \nI don\'t know where we all go from here. But I would suggest taking a deeper look at why these young men are lashing out. Behind the fear and anger, there are real issues. \n', 'Ive been called a ""cucklord"" by enough twelve yearold kids on fortnite to know that what you\'re saying doesn\'t make sense. I guarantee none of those kids are incels, MGTOWs, red pillers, etc. It\'s just their version of ""gay"", ""fag"", ""loser"", etc. That\'s a very very broad statement. I\'ve also heard women call other guys cucks and soyboys. I highly doubt they\'re ""insecure about their masculinity"". This is the argumental equivalent of ""anyone who says a racist thing is unintelligent"", or ""all bullies are insecure"". After reading some of your replies in here I can see you continuously stretch your goal posts. Statements like ""all x are y""  are fundamentally impossible to prove. I feel like this post is one massive troll to waste hundreds or thousands of people\'s time.\n', ""\ncuck\n\nCuck as a political term doesn't refer to masculinity.  Sure, the origin of the term involves a clash of two particular views of masculinity, but that doesn't affect the meaning of the term.  \nThere is a clash in views between cuckolds, men who sexually enjoy watching their wives/girlfriends sleep with other men, and traditionalists, who see sex and marriage as sacred and view their wives/girlfriends sleeping with another man as the ultimate betrayal.  The word cuck, in the political sense, means someone who not only allows himself to be victimized, but approves of it.  \nCuck, in the political sense, came from the analogy between the traditionalist view of literal cuckolds and the way some people act politically.  It came from ideas involving sex (and masculinity to some extent), but it doesn't have anything to do with them directly.  \n\na way to make fun of men that aren't hypermasculine\n\nNot being hypermasculine is not really a reason to use this sort of insult.  There are very, very few hypermasculine men.  You could use these words, especially soyboy, to make fun of hypereffeminate men.  \nThere is no particular reason to assume that insecurity would be the motive for using soyboy as an insult.  If you want to insult a hypereffeminate man, and you're searching for an appropriate insult, soyboy naturally comes to mind.  \n\nEspecially because the only people that are seemingly using those terms are incels, MGTOWs, red pillers and others who's whole world view is based on insecure delusions. \n\nMultiple things wrong with this.  \nFirst, why are you lumping these different groups together?  MGTOW are men who've noticed the biases in law and society against men that make marriage and other long term relationships with women dangerous, and have decided to abstain from long term relationships with women for this reason.  Incels are nihilistic whiny people who have noticed a deficiency in their ability to attract women, and have decided to give up.  Red pillers presumably refers to members of TRP, who think that the key to attracting women is to act 'alpha'.  \nThese three groups are unrelated.  \nSecond, why say their world view is based on insecure delusions?  Incels are insecure and delusional, TRP is delusional, but the opposite of insecure, and MGTOW are neither delusional nor insecure.  \nThird, what makes you think these groups use 'cuck' and 'soyboy'?  As far as I'm aware, they just don't use these terms much, while a certain subset of Trump supporters use them all the time.  \n"", 'So you believe that anyone who uses the word ""cuck"" as an insult is insecure about their own masculinity because:\n\nA lot of people that use it are insecure of their masculinity\n\nand\n\nYou haven\'t met anyone that uses it that isn\'t insecure.\n\nSo both of those premises are correct (I\'d assume), but they definitely don\'t logically mean that ""Guys that are using those terms unironically as a way to make fun of men that aren\'t hypermasculine are insecure about their own masculinity."" That doesn\'t necessarily mean you\'re wrong though. \nInstead, I suggest a person who understands what a cuckold is and what ""cuck"" means, but doesn\'t understand the internet slang and implications of ""cuck"". If he sees a situation where someone is being disrespected or ""walked over"" in a situation, he could make the analogy of ""being a cuck,"" which is insulting, but more or less describes the situation. Essentially some of the traits of a cuckold are the opposite of masculine, and someone could have good justification for using the word ""cuck"" when insulting someone based on those traits.\n', 'Your premise sounds like the old adage, “bullies are bullies because they’re deeply insecure about themselves.” Actually that’s been demonstrated to be incorrect, at least some of the time: https://www.parentingscience.com/pure-bullies.html\nSo actually I think some people who use “cuck” or “soyboy” are very confident and masculine and judge the piss out of anyone who doesn’t conform to the alpha male stereotype.\n', 'I think you are accurate in that SOME people are exactly what you describe. \nThat being said those insults do have there time and place. There is a famous viral video of a white man screaming ""you\'re a fucking  white male""  The critics of the video dubbed him john the cuck or something of the variant. Because he hated his own group of people that much that he used it as an insult or defence or what ever.  It is a display of an amazing amount of frail weakness. And so those words fit him. \nNow lets be clear these are dumb ass joke terms. I have heard them used offline in a very jokey way and its never really used to make a solid point just for laughs. These are stupid terms that should not be used in a serious conversation. \n', 'I disagree. I don’t see a logical connection between calling someone a cuck/soyboy and feeing insecure.

If these men are less masculine are they justified in feeling insecure?\nI ask these questions because it seems to me like you are doing something equally as pernicious as what you are claiming these men are. To me it seems like you want to shut-up men who have had a difficult time socializing and are doing a bad job expressing their pain, by stigmatizing that pain even further using the term ""insecure masculinity"".\nYou are basically using a word that is functionally identical to ""soy boy"" and using it to punch down on people that use the word ""soy boy"", and it\'s basically just as obvious, you literally are suggesting your targets aren\'t masculine. You are gatekeeping masculinity.\nLet me suggest that you are doing this because you see a behaviour you don\'t like and don\'t understand, but it feels to you as if a fellow man is not behaving in a way he should be behaving and therefore is less of a man. \nLet me suggest next to you that they are doing the same thing for the same reason.\n', 'It doesn\'t make you insecure to use those terms, any less than using any disparaging term does.  Being a secure person doesn\'t mean you\'re necessarily a nice person.  You can be a secure douchebag.  \nIt\'s actually very likely the case that secure people use terms like ""soy boy"" and ""cuck"" to describe weak, insecure men.  \n', 'I highly doubt that secure people spend their free time making fun of others and trolling online. \n', ""Moving the goal posts again lol. If I call one of my friends a cuck for bringing an umbrella to a ball game, it's simply a rude, cheap joke at his expense to make my other buddies laugh. I may call the same guy a fat ass if he orders 5 hotdogs. He may call me a toddler if I got to the bathroom 3 times during the game. We have fun ribbing each other. If you say things like that to strangers, it's far more likely that you're an insecure person, I agree. You're essentially saying anyone who insults anyone must be insecure about whatever they're calling out. That's the case sometimes, but I think it's silly to think it is all the time. Case in point, you're calling out a behavior you find objectionable in disparaging terms. I don't necessarily think you're insecure, I don't know you. But if you can't see how you're doing something similar by labeling everyone who says cuck as deluded and insecure, you wasted your time posting this. \n"", 'I don\'t use ""soy boy"" because I\'m a mostly liberal vegetarian. But I can\'t help but find ""cuck"" kind of funny. Especially when you direct it at meat-head type people. It makes steam come out their ears.\nI think ""cuck"" is the new ""fag.""\nHear me out. In the 80\'s or 90\'s when a heterosexual guy called another heterosexual guy a fag, it was a vulgar way of attacking that person\'s masculinity in a sexual fashion.\nBut, times have changed, and a lot of people (even jerks) don\'t want to use a word that can hurt so many other people by proxy.\nSo now there\'s a new word to use to insult someone\'s masculinity in a sexual fashion. No one is born a cuckold though. It\'s kind of a lifestyle choice (I think? I don\'t know). So even gay people can comfortably join in the fun and call some douchbag a cuck.\nThe way I see it, ""cuck"" is a sign of social process. Now get out there and call some obnoxious gweedo a cuck, you crazy kids.\n', ""If you are a boy who's diet consists of a lot of soy, would that make you a soy boy?

It is simple name calling, childish to be sure, but reading into the meaning is doing pretty much the same as they are. \nIf they are a few pounds overweight, they are a whale. Big truck = small cock. Vegitarian = soy boy. not following MeToo or BLM, then sexist or racist. \n"", 'I apologize for the language, but ""soy boy"" is the new non-homophobic use of ""faggot"". ""Faggot"" used to be a word for ""useless person"", and was used for women who didn\'t expect to work after marriage, and men who could not pull their own weight or support their own families. A ""bundle of sticks"", is a burdensome thing to carry around with you, and later on considered ""only good for burning"". While ""Faggot"" is generally considered a homophobic term, there are entire generations of people that never intentionally used the word in order to denegrate homosexuals, but rather effeminate non-working types.\n""soy boys"" and ""cucks"" are specific kinds of useless people. A cuck can\'t satisfy his wife, so she cuckolds him. A soy boy is not a ""sufficiently masculine man"", and so the term implies that they drink estrogen-rich soy instead of calcium-rich milk.\nI\'d say you\'re still half-right though. Some people are insecure that they\'re not sufficiently masculine, or are not secure in their ability to maintain a healthy monogamous relationship. That being said, there are also lots of guys who are happily married and satisfied with their masculinity that use these words, and generally think that soyboys are children that ought to grow up and cucks are pushovers that enter unhealthy one-sided relationships.\nPersonally, I think when men use these words they\'re not using them to empower themselves, they\'re using them in order to denegrate and correct for certain behaviors they think are either childish or fundamentally unnecessary (like letting your girlfriend demand monogamy while simultaneously sleeping with your friends). I\'ll stand by this because I feel when a woman does these things I don\'t think she\'s trying to empower herself or make up for something, she\'s trying to denegrate and correct for undesirable behavior. \nWhy assume that men and women have fundamentally different motives when they use these terms? It\'s more likely the case that soy boys and cucks are just generally considered to be useless men that don\'t stand up for themselves, and that in and of itself constitutes the use of the insult. Bullies are assholes who try to bring people down for their flaws, I don\'t doubt that most of them are probably projecting their own problems, but they\'re not the reason that these terms exist in the first place.\n', ""I think your bias is ruining the attempt. \nThese insults are not the same as 'Man up'.

Naturally, I'm not talking about some edgy teens on 4chan, but genuine male lives pretty much ruined by the cultural expectations, pro-female bias during divorce and especially concerning child custody, or mostly lately positive discrimination, all of which is supported by solid statistical evidence.\n\nAnd because I have never met a confident person in my life that would use such terms, but lots of complete losers that feel that it gives them some kind of power.\n\nI have simply never met a confident and successful person who wasted time insulting or degrading others…\nI agree that people who do this tend to be dissatisfied, sad, angry, feel inferior, etc. and thus compensate to feel a bit better about themselves, however it has little to do with their collective identity. On the contrary, men who are for example masculine may see this as their objective advantage compared to ‘soy boys’ or ‘cucks’ and thus use it to attack them because there's little risk of effective defence.\nThe whole ‘you're just insecure about your own X’ is a pseudo-argument which is often used to wind up the opponent but there's no real basis for this assertion. If you believe there is one, the burden of proof is upon you.\nI accept there may be some men who are motivated specifically by their insecurity with regard to their masculine qualities (e.g. those edgy teens on 4chan I've mentioned), but your conclusion is overly generalised and unsupported by data of which I'm aware.\nLastly, I use the term ‘cuck’ myself to describe males who demean themselves by serving women without any reasonable profit (e.g. I know a guy who's been providing for his crush for years despite her having multiple boyfriends in the meantime) or literal sexual fetishists who find being ‘cucked’ arousing because they suffer from a mental disorder. I believe it's a fitting label in both cases and quite unrelated to my masculinity or lack thereof.\n"", 'I\'ve never used, or have hardly heard the term soy boy, but have used, and would gladly again use the term cuck.

I mean what do I have to be insecure about? What defines masculine insecurity? Cause I definitely have a dick, so I\'m definitely a man.   \nThe term cuck for me is to do with a form of weakness, or more so, weak men who use their weakness to try and gain favor with women. I\'d have no reason to insult a man for not being super manly, hair on the chest, wiping his ass with sandpaper type. I know a guy who is married to this feminazi type. She\'s super overpowering towards not only him, but everyone around her to force them in to agreeing with her point of view.

A lot of immature right leaning folks also throw those terms around as blanket insults for those they disagree with.  To be honest, I\'ve done it before when I just felt like being a dick.  I don\'t think masculinity has anything to do with it, no more so than calling someone a ""fag"" 15 years ago implied that the person was a closet homosexual.  It was just an ""in-vogue"" blanket insult for anyone they felt like insulting.\nPeople who are legitimately disgusted by these folks.  I would say I fall into this camp.  While I don\'t make a habit of running around in public yelling it at people, I certainly think it when I see androgynous guys or people insisting on running their own culture or heritage into the ground while upholding some watered down, generic idea of ""multiculturalism"" and ""tolerance"".\nA incredibly small minority of people who are what you say they are. Mostly, because I\'m sure there are, at least, a few people like this.  I honestly believe, much with the ""fag"" example in number 1, that the vast majority of people using these terms fall into camp 1 or 2.\n\nTo expand on bullet 2, which I believe myself to fall into, I think this is a normal reaction to a stimuli that is in direct opposition to a philosophy or attitude that you center yourself around.   I grew up in a culture where men were expected to be providers, protectors, and producers.  I still hold those values today.  When I see young men at the store that I\'m pretty sure my cat could beat up, I\'m naturally a little disgusted.   \nI work in the oilfield and I\'ve legitimately seen grown men cry and quit after half a day of swinging a sledge hammer.  It isn\'t even the ""bravado"" aspect of it, that kills me.  It\'s the complete lack of effort, the inability to face and overcome hardships, the lack of character, and the fear of conflict of any kind.  I think these ""soft"" men are repulsive not because we have a phobia of them, or that we ""secretly identify"" as them, but rather I believe that men instinctively size each other up.  That may be to determine threat or usefulness, but when the opposite is neither, not though handicap, but through choice, THAT is an inherently repulsive thing to a man entrenched in the protect, provide, produce culture.\n', ""I assume if you use those terms you're an incel. Only time the word cuck is appropriate is if you're a swinger or something like that. To each their own. \n"", ""I say cuck and soy boy literally all the time (mostly to my boyfriend) but that's because I'm a faggot and they're hilarious terms.

In our modern times, this definition of ""man"" is changing and some groups don\'t agree with the redefinition, if you can call it that. There are also those that are still learning ""What a man is"" in the more traditional sense.\nIn those groups, there are a portion that tend to react negatively towards any changes in these traditional things and mock those changes accordingly. Think of it like saying ""The Last Jedi"" was good to old school Star Wars fans. They aren\'t insecure; they just have very strong opinions towards Star Wars. It\'s the same thing; people that use those terms are very passionate towards gender identity and such. When exposed to this redefinition, they use those terms not because they are insecure but because the new definition to them is ridiculous. It would be like saying a Doctor should be a master of dance now instead of a classical definition of a Doctor. The definition has changed in a way that they don\'t agree with, understand, or a mixture of the two.\nI do agree with your general opinion, and I do believe that most people that use those terms are similar to those that you describe. That being said, I also believe that there are people that just are more ""set in their ways"".\nOr, at least imo they could be pandering towards other groups; don\'t Republican Political Commentators use similar terminology? If they do, which I believe they do, then those terms could also just be used to essentially state ""Those Liberals are ridiculous"", which I believe due to the fact that those are politically motivated it is more about politics over insecurity. \n', 'Nah dude you’re right they’re insecure.

15,like10hunters,"Hey guys, first CMV, and this view is one I would love to cast aside if I can see some facts on other important/relevant/successful/talented 'Super Groups'. First off, I suppose I should define Super Group: a super group is a band of three or more members of the music culture who are already considered successful who band together to form a new band or side project. Some examples of these are obviously the Traveling Wilburys (TW), Crosby, stills, nash,(young), the highwaymen, etc.
          My reasoning for crowning TW the reigning champs is because of the caliber of the men involved. Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan are frontiersman of early rock and have both flooded the charts with success and have been and inspiration to many (lay lady lay, like a rolling stone, oh pretty woman, you got it). George Harrison was a bassist for the Beatles and I think his work with them speaks for itself, not to mention his solo work (my sweet lord, blow away, etc) Jeff Lynne being a co-founder of the Elctric Light Orchestra (ELO) and later a leader and main song writer after the departure of his bandmember, Roy Wood.(strange magic, telephone line). Tom petty, who died just last October(RIP) was a founder of his band the heart breakers, as well as a leader for mudcrutch, before that. Some of his popular works include (the waiting, free falling, american girl).
          Now, obviously these men are all very well known and popular. That's the point of a supergroup right? My main argument now comes down to the quality of their music, the quantity of albums (2 in 2 years), and the general way that they all got along and handled their business. The group was formed when Harrison and Lynne were producing Harrison's ""cloud nine"" album. These men all made great music without any ego. They all wrote, they all sang, and they just had a bunch of fun doing it because they are all such good friends. I thoroughly believe this mixture, and the timing in history, makes them the best super group to play together to this date. Now. Let's be civil and have us a good discussion about great music!I apologize for any formatting issues. I wrote this on mobile. This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

16,blackdynomitesnewbag,"In general, I think the 120v and 60Hz standard is better and safer that 240v at 50z and that the higher voltage is generally not needed. Seeing as it would be nearly impossible for any country to switch from one system to the other, I will make most of my arguments assuming technology from the late 19th and early 20th century when decisions where made, but will make some points from a modern perspective.The most compelling reasons to use 240v is that it more readily provides greater power and allows for simpler designs of electronic devices. The two biggest electrical applications around the turn of the century were motors and light bulbs, both of which are easier to design for 240v. Regardless of this, neither were prohibitively difficult to design or make for 120v and the tradeoff with safety was not worth it.Doubling the voltage quadruples the power because power correlates with voltage squared. This means that it is four times easier to kill a person or cause a spark starting a fire. This increased risk requires outlets and plugs to be larger so as to decrease the risk of shock or dangerous spark. The same goes for light switches and just about anything else that interacts with the higher voltage, including the insulation on the wires.Although the safety of 60hz vs 50hz is debated, 60hz is more practice than 50hz. The biggest difference is that 50hz requires larger and less efficient transformer. A smaller but non-trivial difference is that 60hz can be trivially used to keep time (I think I may have confused it with syncing television signals. 60Hz makes using an integer frame rate really).Most devices don't need 240v to work well. I don't know about other countries, but in the United States, only the oven and clothes dryer use 240v. This is possible because 240v is available in the house at the breaker panel. Better yet, 240v is created by using two out of phase 120v lines. This means that a person would have to touch both wires to get a full 240v shock.Another decently compelling argument for 240v is that it wastes less power passing through wires. Most power is lost during transmission from the power station to the home, and transformers are used to step up the voltage during transmission, so 240v vs 120v doesn't matter there. It may matter for very long wire runs in a home, but that can be mitigated by using a thick wire. In most non-commercial applications this won't be an issue.Up until TV's started using digital tuners, the frequency of the power grid was used to draw frames. Using 60 Hz allowed more frames per second. And in today's world, many if not most electronics don't care about frequency or voltage as they use digitally controlled adaptors to lower the voltage.","['DeltaBot', 'iateapietod', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'in_cavediver', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Bladefall', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Pilebsa', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'DeltaBot', 'iateapietod', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'iateapietod', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'bestdnd', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'KungFuDabu', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'itrubstheloshun', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'in_cavediver', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'in_cavediver', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'in_cavediver', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'in_cavediver', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'verfmeer', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Sternenkrieger', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Sternenkrieger', 'Yenorin41', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'Any19', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Any19', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Any19', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Any19', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Any19', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Any19', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'timoth3y', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'remember_that_girl', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'centsentscent', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'DeltaBot', 'bestdnd', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'Yenorin41', 'blackdynomitesnewbag', 'DeltaBot', 'JTex2', 'blackdynomitesnewbag']","[""/u/blackdynomitesnewbag (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""So I won't act like I know too large an amount on the subject, but I do want to point out that 60 hz vs 50 hz means any motor connected will run faster.

If you are in a situation where you are conducting through your body, and your service is not limiting the power delivered, you are going to die.

Yes a house may have about the same power service, but it takes much less than that to stop a heart. General rule of thumb, 1mA can be felt, 10mA will hurt, and 100mA will stop a heart. It may not even take that much. That's 1000x less than a 100A service.\nCurrent is a function of voltage and resistance. Your body has a resistance between 400kΩ and 4MΩ depending on how wet your skin is and which to points you choose. At 120v, that gives you a current of no less than 30mA. Double the voltage, double the current. That's 60mA, pretty close to that 100mA threshold of guaranteed cardiac arrest. Power is I2/R. Double the current, quadruple the power. Risk of cardiac arrest scales with power, not current.\n"", ""So, here is the counter point.\nBasic Ohms law. V=I*R\nI have a toaster. It draws 12amps at 120V. I can drop that load to 6 amps by going to 240V. In doing that, I need a smaller conductor to carry the same load. Copper is expensive.\nSecond example - Power loss in wiring. In general, it is desired to keep the voltage drop at or below 3%. Wire is a resistor - a very low value resistor but a resistor none the less. If I have a wire with a 1/4 Ohm resistance. At 120V, a 10 Amp load, 1200 watts, will have a voltage drop of 2.5V in the wire and it will dissipate 25 watts of power. The same wire, with a 240V 5 Amp load, 1200 watts, will have a 1.25V drop and only dissipate 6.25 watts.\nUsing the example above, the 120V line has a 2.1% voltage drop which is pretty close to the max allowed. The 240V line has a 0.5% voltage drop. In practical terms, the 120V device is getting 98% of the voltage is wants and the 240 device is getting 99.5% of the desired input voltage. \nThis is the reason power distribution is done at very high voltages. Power losses due to resistive heating in conductors can be huge.\nNow, lets talk safety. Current kills and it takes about 15ma to kill you. The question is about getting current to flow. The higher the voltage, the more likely it is to pass through the body. There is a marginal increase in ability for 240V to flow over 120V. That said, it is marginal and 120V will flow quite readily. It it goes across your heart, you are in for a bad day. Given the worldwide usage of 240V and the usage of it in the US, I don't think this means anything in the real world. The difference, while technically there, just does not matter.\nFrequency matters but for different reasons. Most AC motors are built for a specific frequency of rotation. If you use a 50hz motor on 60hz line, you get a different speed. This is actually a great trick used for 3-phase motors to get a variable speed motor. Look up Frequency drives or Freq drives.\nOne is really not superior to the other. (or 400Hz which is also used for that matter). They are just different standards for AC power equipment.\nEDIT: Fixed out of order paragraph\n"", ""I'm very familiar with Ohms law, and I acknowledge that using a higher voltage means less power is dropped on the conductor. With a 14g wire, you'd need 100ft (30 meters) to get a 1/4Ω. That's pretty long for a residence with a well placed breaker box. A 3%± goal is admirable, but the unloaded voltage from the line swings by more than that. Plus that loss is trivial compared to the transmission losses. Similarly, the biggest cost for electrical wiring will be for transmission lines. Regardless, I think the the trade off of having thicker wires in exchange for greater safety is better.\nCurrent does kill, that's right, and 240v will double the current and quadruple the energy dropped on the heart.\nThree phase is super cool. Not only does make variable speed motors easier to run, but it also gives constant power. I still think frequency does matter. Too low and you need huge transformers to prevent the core from saturating.

It is also impacted by the ampicity derating required for multiple conductors in a raceway. Very few residential electricians consider this when routing wires but when you place multiple conductors (circuits) in the same sealed raceway or wall cavity, you amplify the heating issues. Throw in insulation and it makes it worse.

18,carter1984,"So I believe that Mohammed bin Salman is genuinely working towards implementing wester reforms in Saudi Arabia, and most importantly, working to move the nation away from wahhabism to a much more moderate and worldwide acceptable form of Islam.

Or is even overtly controlled by Abu Dhabi like Socotra which they have occupied.\nThe idea that Yemen has to be “kept united” or that any side enjoys democratic legitimacy in this conflict is ridiculous, as is the idea that Iran had/has a hand in stoking it.

19,ChickenSaladYo,"Hello everyone, I have an opinion that really has no basis in facts or statistics, it is just a gut opinion of mine. I believe that life starts at conception. I am a male. I do not believe abortions are ethical (with exceptions to rape, incest or the abortion being necessary to preserve the mother's life). I would hope that my partner would not terminate a pregnancy, but I also recognize that women are in a situation unique to their gender. Men will never be trapped in a pregnancy and forced to carry a human baby to term. Literally, men cannot become impregnated. Due to the unique circumstances of this issue, I do not think men should be allowed to decide whether or not a woman can or cannot receive an abortion. I do not have a solution or suggestion as to how we would only let women decide on abortion rights. As strongly as I feel against abortions, I believe reproductive rights (not only limited to abortions) should be fully in place and protected for women. If someone doesn't believe in using birth control or termination, that is perfectly acceptable. But that does not give them a right to stop others from exercising their rights.

Yet of the roughly 40,000 adults who crossed the border that month, 24,300 were without children. This means that they could have easily selected and prosecuted the same number of adults, while entirely avoiding locking up any children. Heck, they could have prosecuted even more adults if they had used the resources used on processing children, to prosecute more adults.\nThis demonstrates that locking up children isn't merely some unfortunate/unavoidable consequence of the policy.

In this case, I believe there are laws in place that allow immigrants to come at a steady pace that wouldn’t disrupt or drain the American system.

Who would support these people, seeing that they’re fleeing from gang-violence, poverty, etc. There just isn’t enough resources to go around and I don’t think the average tax-payer wants an increase in taxes to support such a large community. Of course, that number is outstanding, but my point is there are laws that allow the flow of people to come in at a reasonable rate. \nSo when the consequence is seperating families, I agree because there are ways to get into America or Canada or any other wonderful country that don’t include breaking the law as soon as you cross country lines. Your kids can’t be locked up in jail with you, there isn’t enough tax dollars allocated to building new big bright facilities for kids (and tax payers shouldn’t be burdened with this), and placing children with relatives can run the risk of them being lost in the system, therefore they end up living in America unlawfully anyway. \nAs a parent, you are allowing your child to be a part of your crime.

This didn’t start just last week. \nOn another note, studies have shown more than half of those seeking asylum don’t even know the definition of asylum.

And even a carefully crafted explanation as to why would end in the same question, because people love ripping into vegans too much.\nBesides which, most vegans would argue that there is no way to humanely take an animal\'s life, regardless of how well they\'re treated during it. There\'s no humane way of milking a cow, because while you\'re milking it it\'s either trapped in a box or a field and doesn\'t get any say in it.

I have seen vegans getting fresh eggs from places like sanctuaries or even chickens they\'ve rescued themselves, but that\'s about it.\nSupporting small, ""more humane"" industry is still supporting the industry, as some of the money going to the farmers etc you want to support will go to the slaughterhouse they used, other farmers they\'ve traded/bred with, and any other less ethical places they\'ve had dealings with. And whichever way you look at it, if you\'re supporting a cow farmer, you\'re supporting the killing of cows. \nThis doesn\'t mean vegans have to shout about it and make a huge fuss over everyone else doing it - some do because it\'s how they try to make a difference to those animals, but even just not paying into the industry is better than paying a large amount of money for most likely worse tasting meat all in the name of supporting someone who was nicer to his animals until he stacked them up in a small trailer and drove them to the nearest death box.\n', 'I think you’re right about the negative reaction someone would receive for claiming veganism and still eating meat.

As of right now, I don't think there is a truly humane alternative in the meat industry.\nBesides which, if as you say there aren't enough vegans to effectively boycott the industry (too many people will continue to buy meat) then what makes you think vegans supporting the most humane parts of the industry will more effectively change anything? You can still apply the same argument that there will be too many people buying the cheap, inhumane meat to save money and because it's what they already know and love, and so the only effect that vegans will have is in keeping small, somewhat more humane businesses afloat while the general populace continues to keep bigger, less ethical corporations  in the limelight. So in effect, all this achieves is that now vegans are eating expensive, still morally questionable meat, meaning they don't even get the respect for sticking to their principles when they argue their case, and still having little to no effect on the industry as a whole.

For meat it\'s pretty obvious, no matter how great their life on the farm is, they get killed at the end. \nFor milk products it\'s already a bit more complicated, you\'d have to take the calf away from the mother.

That increase being equal to whatever meet the vegans buy. \nVegans are such a tiny percentage of the population that they could never constitute enough of the market share to influence more humane practices. Their market share is so small that without even looking at hard numbers it’s pretty clear the industry wouldn’t justify using more humane (expensive) practices to get those new customers. As in the new costumers aren’t worth the cost. \nSo yeah at best you might get some humane high priced specialty meet sellers but the only ones who are going to care enough to pay the higher price are the vegans. If the general consumer cared enough the market would’ve already shifted to more humane conditions. \nSo all you’ve done is get more animals killed. Sure they’ll be treated more humanely then other animals but again without the vegans buying the meat they wouldn’t have been bred and killed in the first place\n', 'Yeah I suppose you’re right. Although I’d argue that there are already farms and businesses that are as humane and respectful as possible in their practices. It wouldn’t need a new market, I believe there already exists the market but it needs support. \n', 'If you traveled back in time to 1830s America, how would you respond if someone said the following?\n\nIf someone’s reason for becoming an anti-slavery abolitionist is the welfare of slaves, would it not be more effective to support the smaller businesses and farms that are trying to do it right - all while working against the market? If the only people that care enough about slaves to make a change boycott products made by slave labor altogether, are they not paving the way for bigger, inhumane businesses and farms to dominate the market even more than they already do?\nI understand this does not deal with other facts of the industries that use slave labor. I’m talking more about cruelty to slaves. There are definitely businesses and farms out there that treat their slaves with the upmost respect.\nThere are too few anti-slavery-abolitionists to boycott the all of products that are made by slave labor effectively. This would only mean the people that supposedly don’t care about slaves are the only people left effecting the market. Surely these people will go for the cheapest options, which are usually provided through slave labor.\nI argue it would be more effective to support farms and businesses that take care and respect their slaves by buying and consuming their products, even though they are usually more expensive.\nAgain this would only apply to people who are against slavery for the sole reason of boycotting cruelty to slaves within the industries that use slaves.\n\n', 'Forgive me for the lengthy reply, but this is an issue that many people wrestle with (vegans and non-vegans alike) so I think it warrants some attention.\nI think the issue is that many people seem to be looking at the problem from the top-down; of course one person is going to appear to not be making much of a difference if you\'re looking at the animal agriculture industry as a whole.\nTry looking at it from the bottom-up. Every time you don\'t eat an animal, you are potentially sparing one being a miserable existence and violent slaughter. This makes a massive difference to that individual.\nLet\'s imagine that you and I are kayaking on a huge lake and in the distance we see a large boat capsize. We get closer and realize that it has thrown a few hundred children in the water. We discuss what we should do and realize that if we go back to shore for help, they will all drown by the time help arrives. We can help, but we only have enough room to save one or two children. Should we leave because we can\'t save them all and saving one or two of them won\'t make that big of a difference, or should we try to save the one or two that we can? This could be extended to environmental causes as well; should each of us do what we can to lower our impact on the environment, or should we just feel free to spew greenhouse gasses and pollutants as much as we can since a single individual can\'t change the entire system?\nA similar situation is described in the boy and the starfish parable:\n\nOne day a man was walking along the beach when he noticed a boy picking something up and gently throwing it into the ocean.\nApproaching the boy, he asked, ""What are you doing?""\nThe youth replied, ""Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The surf is up and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw them back, they’ll die.""\n""Son,"" the man said, ""don’t you realize there are miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish? You can’t possibly make a difference!""\nAfter listening politely, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it back into the water. Then, smiling at the man, he said, ""I made a difference for that one.""\n\nEven from the top-down, there are major and observable changes happening with the food industry, and these changes are happening at an increasing pace.\nJust 20 or so years ago, not many people had even heard the term vegan. Plant-based milks were scarce and you\'d be lucky to find even simple soy milk. Faux-meats were virtually non-existent, except for the occasional lackluster frozen veggie burger. \nNow, in 2018, much of the developed world is aware of veganism. The markets have adapted as the demand for more vegetarian and vegan options has grown. Not only is soy milk available in almost every town, but many areas now have multiple varieties and brands of cashew milk, almond milk, rice milk, oat milk, and coconut milk. A vegan mayo has taken away so much market share from the major players that that it even caught the attention of the president of the American Egg Board, who called the product ""a major threat to the future of the egg product business."" The faux meat industry has grown from selling a handful of low-quality unappetizing product to a huge range of high-quality plant-based meats. Vegan substitute companies like Beyond Meat and Hampton Creek are attracting huge investors like Bill Gates. Google even tried to purchase Impossible Foods.\nEven major fast-food and restaurant chains tout the fact that they have vegetarian and vegan options. Twenty years ago, this would have been unheard of. Taco Bell regularly advertises their meat-free options and the fact that they have menu items certified by the American Vegetarian Association. Wendy\'s recently announced a black-bean burger. Fast-casual burrito chains like Chipotle, Pancheros, and Moe\'s have begun offering sauteed or grilled tofu as a protein option right alongside their meat options. Even White Castle has had a vegan burger on their menu (link2), and White Castle have recently rolled-out Impossible Sliders to all of their locations. The pizza chains Mod Pizza, Blaze Pizza and & Pizza offer a vegan cheese option for every pizza. Most other chains have made an effort to include at least a few vegan or vegetarian options on the menu, even if it\'s just a simple veggie burger.\nThere have even been some completely vegan chain restaurants emerge with locations around the US, like Native Foods and Veggie Grill. These thriving businesses would not have been possible just 20 years ago.\nU.S. vegetarian food sales, which is a category that includes things like soy milk and faux meat and not simply produce, doubled between 1998 and 2003.\nIn 2016, Tyson Foods (one of the largest players in the meat industry in the world) announced that they are investing in plant-based meat-alternatives, and bought stake in a vegan meat company. In 2018, when asked why they invested in Beyond Meat, a spokesperson for Tyson said: ""We are a consumer products group and we sell delicious food to people all around the world, and as consumer\'s preferences change and diets change, it\'s our responsibility to go where the customers are going to be.""\nIn the UK, the rate of veganism has gone up by over 360% over the past decade, and vegan food sales have risen by 1500% in the last year.\nIn 2017, Canadian meat-producer Maple Leaf Foods bought a stake in Lightlife Foods, a company that produces plant-based vegan meat products, due to the increased demand for these types of products. Later in the year, they bought Field Roast, another company specializing in plant-based meats and cheeses. \nMarketwired reports, “Growth of alternative protein sources is poised to accelerate, potentially claiming up to a third of the protein market by 2054, profoundly affecting agriculture, food technology, and end products, according to Lux Research.”\nIn 2017, Cargill, the largest privately held food and agriculture company in the world and one of the largest beef producers in the US, sold off its feedlot operations to divert funds to expand into other protein options, including plant-based proteins.\nIn 2017, at a dairy industry conference in Chicago, the CEO of Select Milk Producers said ""I think the threat is very serious,"" in reference to plant-based milks taking market share away from conventional dairy-based milk.\n2017, TGI Fridays restaurants started offering the plant-based ""Beyond Burger"" at all of its locations.\n2017, The Impossible Burger is launched across the US.\n2017, Pizza Hut starts offering vegan cheese at all of their UK locations.\n2017, Baum & Whiteman Food & Restaurant Consultants identified plant-based (vegan) food as the #1 trend for the industry to plan for in 2018. http://www.baumwhiteman.com/2018%20forecast(1).pdf\nIt\'s clear that the millions and millions of vegetarians and vegans in the world have made a difference.\n', '\nIf the only people that care enough about animals to make a change boycott the industry altogether, are they not paving the way for bigger, inhumane businesses and farms to dominate the market even more than they already do?\n\nNo: they are using their dollars to support plant-based companies instead. Remember, it\'s not a choice between either supporting ""cruel meat"" companies or ""nice meat"" companies. Rather, it\'s a choice between support ""cruel meat"", ""nice meat"", or ""non-meat"". It\'s hard to see how taking money away from plant-based companies to support ""nice meat"" companies would somehow result in improved animal welfare.\nIt\'s also worth point out that, sadly, the realities of our economy make ""nice meat"" or ""nice dairy"" somewhat unrealistic. Allowing animals to live to their natural life span, free range captivity, enrichment, allowing calves to stay with their mothers, not keeping dairy cows in a state of near-pregnancy... these basic welfare steps would immediately raise the cost of meat or dairy to prices that are simply unmarketable. \n\nThere are too few vegans to boycott the meat, dairy, and other animal product industries effectively.\n\nThis simply isn\'t true, although it is true that the size of the \'effect\' (in \'effectively\') is small. Vegans can and do allow the creation of plant-based products and companies. A sustained income stream of vegan customers convinces companies to offer more (and better!) plant-based alternatives. The near-future prospect of lab grown meat is a good example of this: it\'s not unreasonable to think that the vegan market, while small, was instrumental in encouraging research in this area, and if these meat replacement products go on to substantially replace animal products in the future, it will be in no small part due to the purchasing power of vegans today.\nIn other words, the goal of veganism ""here and now"" isn\'t so much to single-handedly take down the entire meat industry sometime next year, but merely encourage a slight shift in the market share.\n', 'It\'s an easy math problem \nEvery vegan: 0 animals used for human consumption (and other products)\nEvery ""ethical consumer"": X animals used ""in humane conditions"" \nEven if you could established something you consider  ""humane"" it would still be breeding, caging, butchering animals.\nSince 0 will always be less than X, a vegan has a bigger impact.\n', 'Because welfare standards are undefined in such a way that ""free range"" chickens only means that there can be no more than 5 chickens per square meter, and because I can\'t physically see the act of killing in a supposedly ""humane"" farm to see if I do actually find it morally ok, I abstain from animal products completely. In my view, if there is a chance that my actions can cause suffering, I err on the side of caution.\nI\'m a vegan but I\'m not against killing perse. Nature is metal and killing is part of the natural order of things. What I\'m against is needless suffering. If I can\'t absolutely guarentee that there was zero harm in that animals life and that the death was instant, ie ""humane"", i would rather just get myself a veggie burger.\nOn an industrial scale, I think truly humane killing is impossible in any case so a society that only eats ""ethical"" meat is even more unlikely than a totally vegan world\n']",https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9ow87x/cmv_vegans_would_have_a_better_impact_on/,CMV: Vegans would have a better impact on supporting the welfare of animals in the food industry by supporting businesses and farms that treat their animals humanely,['https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9ow87x/cmv_vegans_would_have_a_better_impact_on/e7xahn3/'],['/u/happy_red1'],"[""Hopefully :) also feel free to delta if I've actually made a change in opinion, I'm hungry for those internet points ;)\n""]",48.64,"[[76.72, 60.89, 69.41, 38.93, 76.05, 45.59, 65.01, 94.15, 94.15, 70.63, 57.1, 73.68, 51.18, 70.13, 74.35, 108.03, 73.85, 52.36, 69.21, 65.42, 56.89, 66.88, 47.72, 34.6, 63.93]]"
22,bennetthaselton,"When an institution (such as a college) gives any weight to the identities of the people who wrote an applicant's letters of recommendation (in other words, being unduly influenced by a letter of recommendation from a senator or a CEO), this unfairly penalizes students who might have been objectively better qualified but didn't happen to know anyone influential.  It sends an anti-meritocratic message that ""who you know"" matters more than the quality of your work.​A student might very well deserve a glowing letter of recommendation from a senator.  But if they do deserve it, then that will already be reflected in the list of accomplishments on their application anyway.  If the senator reviewed their list of accomplishments before writing their letter, presumably the admissions committee can review that list of accomplishments themselves.  By taking the senator's letter out of the equation, you avoid favoring people who happen to know the senator.​Now, one legitimate purpose of a letter of recommendation would be to convey information that doesn't fit elsewhere on the application -- e.g. that Anna overcame tremendous adversity at home to maintain her high grades.  But you could achieve that goal with anonymized letters -- the letter could be received by one university office, which verifies that the sender is a teacher, professor, etc. (i.e. someone who is probably telling the truth), and then anonymizes the letter before giving it to the admissions committee.  This will allow letters to convey relevant information, without favoring a student who happens to know a senator.​There is one case where perhaps it would make sense to favor a student who got a letter of recommendation from a senator.  Perhaps the student is applying for a major that leads to a career which depends a great deal on leveraging connections, and a letter of recommendation from a senator is an early sign that you are good at leveraging connections, and hence would be good at that career.  (Or, more directly, it shows you already have connections, which you can continue using after you graduate, thus reflecting glory on the institution that gave you the degree!)  But that would make a lot less sense if you are applying to study, say, particle physics.  If student A is better at the skills needed for particle physics, but student B happens to know a more influential person to write their letter of recommendation, I can't think of any rational reason that student B should get the spot.​For this reason, I think it would make sense for an institution like MIT to take the lead and anonymize all applicant letters of recommendation, or drop the letter-of-recommendation requirement entirely.  Among other benefits, it would enable them to throw more shade at Harvard (""If you can't hack it on standardized tests but your daddy knows a Senator, kindly take your business down the street"").​CMV!","['DeltaBot', 'notshinx', 'bennetthaselton', 'Seraph062', 'notshinx', 'DeltaBot', 'cacheflow', 'bennetthaselton', 'cacheflow', 'trying629', 'GnosticGnome', 'DocCannery84', 'bennetthaselton', 'DocCannery84', 'fryamtheiman', 'bennetthaselton', 'fryamtheiman', 'bennetthaselton', 'bennetthaselton', 'fryamtheiman', 'cdb03b', 'bennetthaselton', 'cdb03b', 'bennetthaselton', 'cdb03b', 'huggiesdsc', 'bennetthaselton', 'huggiesdsc', 'bennetthaselton', 'DeltaBot']","[""/u/bennetthaselton (OP) has awarded 2 delta(s) in this post.\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in /r/DeltaLog.\nPlease note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n"", ""I have two bones to pick here:\nCase 1:\nLet's say I am a linguistics student.

I think this is optimistic about the fairness of such a process, and that the opportunity is going to depend a lot on luck and who you know.  So perhaps my real issue is that the ""who you know"" problem occurs long before we get to the letter-writing stage.\nLook at it this way: There are always more people who want a position like that, than the number of spots available.  Unless the process of getting those spots is perfectly meritocratic, the people who get those spots are going to have a big unfair advantage over the ones who don\'t.\nBy contrast, getting high standardized test scores is not a finite resource.

Shouldn\'t the fact that Student A figured out how to do it be the important thing? A major part of a college education is the ability to go out and solve problems yourself (as opposed to the \'high school\' model of being applying a solution given to you by your teacher). Getting a position like is a decent indicator of self-drive and problem solving, both of which are highly desirable skills.  \nAlso, while there might be only one position with Chomsky, there is also a range of options between ""Noam Chomsky"" and ""Some guy at my university"". The fact that you end up with the 2nd or 3rd best linguistics professor isn\'t going to \'hurt\', and really if you can demonstrate a good narrative. So something like ""I read some papers by Prof. Z and I was really interested in his work so I did A, B, and C. So I worked convince him to take me on over the summers for research at his university blah blah blah."" combined with a well written recommendation letter is going to be very helpful.  \nMy example in the STEM field is that being the #1 student at a \'decent\' university is more impressive looking than being a \'decent\' student at say MIT.

23,mugen_is_here,"I've heard the saying that ""Efforts are never in vain"" and I want to believe that. But I can't currently. Let me explain why:We all know that long term happiness is deeper than short-term happiness. Also, that if you want to achieve your long-term goals then you need to make sacrifices, have determination, focus on your goal etc.However, the catch is that you don't always meet your goal. And that leads to wastage of all your efforts. For example, let's say that your goal is to generate a side income. You think up of a lot of options and then finally settle down onto writing a novel.You find out how to write a novel, construct a plot, characters, dialog and other stuff like editing, beta readers etc. You start writing a novel. Then you figure out how to generate suspense. You put a hell lot of effort and publish your book. But it doesn't sell. All that effort gets wasted. After searching around without ideas you start looking for other ideas for a side income.Let's suppose that your next goal is to learn Python (or whatever you want to learn), and you plan to teach it to people for a price.As you start learning Python it you realize that there are tonnes and tonnes of options out there. And the competition is pretty fierce here. You create a course and put it up for sale. Try to promote it as much as you can. But nobody buys it. This is the second stage of your wastage.Next, you decide to create a course with specialization in some aspect of Python. You do everything that you can to get people. Figure out what is what, create an audience, You spend money on ads, you spend on a web host, domain name, site template, plugins etc.After a year of all this you have hardly made any sales. This is the third proof.Your efforts for whatever goal you choose, can be wasted. It is even possible that the entire 100% of the effort can get wasted.Can we change this view - ""Effort can be wasted""?Edit: I will try to reply as quickly as possible.

There is room to argue that different countries with different moral ad political traditions should have different laws; some of us outlaw the death penalty, some of us behead people in soccer stadiums.  That's distasteful, but it's the price we pay for respecting the sovereignty of nations.\nBut if you're trying to suppress reports of what goes on in your country that's another matter entirely.  If you're doing that. you know what you're doing is wrong, you do it anyway, and you try to avoid the consequences.\n2) There is a fundamental difference between what you do within you borders and what you do in another country, and there is a basic level of respect that must be paid to diplomatic norms.  You do not murder people in a consulate.  It is not done.  It is not acceptable behavior from any country on the planet.  It is a fundamental betrayal of the norms that let diplomacy function.\n3) On a purely practical note, it matters very much who authorized this murder.  Presuming it was the Saudis (as seems likely), it really matters whether MBS knew about it or authorized it.  If he did, the reformist image he's presented to the world is bullshit.  If he didn't authorize it, someone other than the King of Saudi Arabia is directing the intelligence services and Royal Guard - that is very significant when it comes to our strategic partnership.\nThis killing is deeply significant to other regional power players.  The Turks (also our allies) are enraged because they see this as a murder of a dissident on their soil.  Every other regime in the region will look to our response to determine just what they can get away with - can they murder dissidents without consequence, or will stepping out of line cost dearly?  If we do nothing, it will become clear that Saudi Arabia (and to a lesser extent, our other Arab allies) have carte blanche to murder as necessary.\nAmerica must react to this killing because we are the primary supporters and enablers of the Saudi regime.  We're the ones who can pull the rug out at will.  We're the ones who can - in the most extreme case - annihilate the regime with impunity.  We're the ones who need to punish them if they're guilty.  Nobody else can.\n"", ""To your points:\n1) I don't disagree that freedom of the press is sacrosanct in our system, but I don't see much of a moral difference between sentencing someone to public execution for adultery and suppressing the media. Totalitarian regimes never have a free press.\n2) We murder people in other countries all the time. We also set up black sites in other countries where we torture people. It's not really a betrayal of the norms that we established already.\n3) If it was MBS, you can be both a reformer and a totalitarian leader. His reforms were never meant to loosen his family's grip on the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, they were meant to modernize the economy and open the country up to a slightly more secular existence. That never meant the government was going to stop being a brutal dictatorship.\n"", '\nI don\'t disagree that freedom of the press is sacrosanct\n\nYou clearly disagree if you\'re willing to look at the assassination of a journalist on foreign soil, say ""meh"" and move on.  That\'s not what sacrosanctity looks like, it\'s what extreme violability looks like.  You\'re explicitly accepting that we should accept it when other countries murder people who tell the world what goes on in those countries.  You\'re essentially choosing not to know what goes on in Saudi Arabia because reasons.\n\nI don\'t see much of a moral difference between sentencing someone to public execution for adultery and suppressing the media.\n\nI can name a few pertinent to this case: there was no due process, that in turn means there was no rule of law, the attack was conducted on foreign soil in flagrant violation of longstanding diplomatic norms that even the Taliban can respect.  It\'s bad to suppress the publication of domestic media, it\'s an entirely separate thing to hunt them down across the world and murder them.\nYou can only say you see no moral difference if you ignore national sovereignty, laws, due process, diplomatic norms, and Saudi respect for America\'s political obligations in the region.  Which is to say: everything that matters apart from the basic murdering of a human who didn\'t need to die.\n\nWe murder people in other countries all the time.\n\nDo we? Why?  Do we make a habit of killing dissenting journalists?  Could we not have killed Edward Snowden years ago?  We tend to kill terrorists, militants, or those in their periphery - often in ethically dubious ways, but the intent is never to kill the uninvolved.  When we do something else, it\'s regarded as an error and a mistake.  It\'s reported on and publicly criticized by journalists.\nAnd to be clear: the torture of a suspected terrorist, while immoral, is miles apart from the torture and murder of a journalist.  One is a hubristic mistake, the other is pure evil.\n\nThat never meant the government was going to stop being a brutal dictatorship.\n\nThat was literally how the meaning was interpreted by every competent observer.  Either the reforms signaled liberalization within the regime or they were window dressing.  Everyone knew this - nobody expected overnight transformation, but the point was he was moving them towards liberalization.  If MBS did order the hit, they\'re window dressing.  If he didn\'t there\'s a different problem.\nSaying ""they were going to be an autocratic monarchy anyway"" is a facile and shortsighted argument.\n', ""You're almost totally correct, except that some murders matter more from a geopolitical perspective than others, because they make a statement about the nature and relationship of the countries and people involved. Khashoggi's murder matters more than others because he was a Washington Post columnist, a permanent resident of the United States, and because the killing happened outside Saudi Arabia, in that order.\nAssuming for the sake of your post that the Saudi regime didn't intend for the world to know that it was responsible for the murder, it still made an accidental statement that it considers it acceptable to murder permanent residents of America who write opinions for major American news organizations, outside of Saudi Arabia. If the United States does nothing, then people who fit that description are now perceived as not protected by the American state, and it's now open season. There are many prominent people who fit that description.\nLikewise, no matter how tarnished its reputation, America strategically benefits from being a great power that is perceived to try to do the right thing (as compared to, say, the Russians or the Chinese). Similarly, America benefits when it is perceived to be able to protect those who are close to it, and as a permanent resident of the United States and a writer for a major American publication, Khashoggi qualifies, even if he doesn't merit the same ferocity of response that America would extend if he was a citizen. A failure to inflict some sort of punishment jeopardizes all of this.\nTo make a very crude analogy, for Saudi Arabia to murder someone like Khashoggi with so little subtlety is the equivalent of a small-time crook murdering a guy who runs a pawn shop on a street controlled by a powerful gang in broad daylight. It's an affront to the powerful gang that someone would brazenly employ violence against a person in their territory without their permission, whether the pawn shop owner paid protection money or not. If it goes unpunished it makes others on that street wonder who's really in charge, and the powerful gang loses face.\n"", ""\nTo change my view, you'll need to assert why this murder is a major geo-political shift that puts American interests in jeopardy.\n\nSince you want to look at this as a completely rational actor, then let's be rational.\nSaudi Arabia is our client state. Without us they would not exist. In exchange for our protection they enforce the Petro dollar in OPEC.\nWhen we kill people around the world, they are not journalists saying 9/11 was in inside job. It's citizens and non citizens directly or indirectly associated with people actively trying to kill Americans or NATO citizens.\nIt becomes immoral, because sometimes innocents get in the crossfire. But no war was won without collateral damage.\nThat is not the same as a American green card holder getting chopped up because he posted a couple critical articles in a prominent American newspaper.\nOptics is everything. We kill murderers/terrorist/enemies/traitors extra judicially. That is bad. But it's not the same as killing minor dissident with a bone saw (this journalist was not some radical Julian Assange).\nWe need to step in because our client state needs to know it's role. Nobody at that level of power is against state sanctioned killings; even in foreign countries. But for fucks sake; do it right or don't do it at all. One way of knowing whether you are doing it right is if the victim can easily be defended in moral court. It's easy to defend the state killing of a guy who is the right hand man or press officer of a mass murdering jihadist. It is not morally hard to defend a moderate journalist who was chopped up for the most mild of criticisms against his government.\nWe don't stand for that; and neither should our client state.\n"", '\nSure, we\'re supposed to be a beacon of freedom and democracy to the rest of the world, but the murder of one man is not that important in the global scheme of things.\n\nHow many murders would be?\nThe problem with the ""just one guy"" argument is that it implies there is some point at which it would be too many guys, but doesn\'t really give any guide post for when that would be.\nCould SA kill five guys? 25? At what point does the blood outweigh the arms sales? \n', 'Mohammad bin Salman has only been Crown prince a year. He is clearly testing boundaries with the US and with the world.

And like you said, it’s not a US citizen (though he is tied to the US) and it wasn’t on US soil. So that’s not a big proportion. \nThe last thing we want to do, however, is encourage this psycho.

Just because Black Widow and Brown Recluse spiders kill people in exceptionally rare circumstances is no reason that all their harmless spider buddies can't still be considered dope.\n\nThe Black Widow and Brown Recluse spiders kill 6.5 people per year. They are usually young children that do not get medical attention right away.\n\nAnd that doesn't account for the fact that spiders help kill mosquitoes which help save people from malaria, dengue fever, zika fever, west nile, etc.  So spiders save more lives than they kill.\nNow you may counter that dragon flies do that too, which is absolutely true, but dragonflies just aren't as plentiful as spiders so just aren't killing anywhere close to as many mosquitoes.  I couldn't find great numbers to support this claim, so for now it is just speculation on my part, but dragon flies have 3000 species and spiders have 45,000 species.\n\nIt is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year.\n\nI don't have a corresponding number for dragonflies.\n\ncoolness of abilities\n\nSpider webs are pretty cool, but that doesn't account for all the neat ways in which different spiders hunt:\n\nBolas: Bolas spiders are unusual orb-weaver spiders that do not spin the webs. Instead, they hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk on the end of a line, known as a 'bolas'. By swinging the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook.\nTrapdoor: Trapdoor spiders construct burrows with a cork-like trapdoor made of soil, vegetation and silk. The trapdoor is difficult to see when it is closed because the plant and soil materials effectively camouflage it. The trapdoor is hinged on one side with silk.\n\nOther spiders hunt on land or hunt in water, even catching small fish in some cases. Some use deception or even keep nets on their legs in which they strike out and grab their prey in a net.\n"", ""\nIt's unfair to judge all spider by the behavior of some.\n\nWell how else can I judge them if not with a species wide average? Spiders definitely can kill. Even if very few do, the average spider still has a higher probability of killing you than the average dragonfly. They also bite humans much more frequently.\n\ndragonflies just aren't as plentiful as spiders so just aren't killing anywhere close to as many mosquitoes\n\nI don't think it's fair to evaluate dopeness based on population size. We're evaluating the bugs themselves. So I think any large scale statistics like that should be divided by pop. size.\n\nSpider webs are pretty cool\n\nDefinitely, but that's only one variable.\nThe other hunting methods are pretty cool too, but again, that's only an ability, and I believe that dragonflies soundly beat them in other ways.\nEdit: I'm actually going to consider versatility as another variable. That brings them closer together. partial ∆\n"", ""I think weighing the hunting techniques of the two is extremely interesting, and worth taking a deeper dive on. Some more points:\nSpiders\n\nSpiders are undeniably smarter than dragonflies. We talked about their versatility, but I'll add some points to that. Jumping spiders are able to lock onto targets from (relatively) far away, and then calculate different attack paths to maximize their chance of success. Portia spiders specifically are also extremely smart, with a wide range of hunting techniques from strumming other spiders webs (their diet is mostly spiders) and luring them close by imitating a caught animal, to dropping in an ambushing a spider. Take that in for a second, they ambush an animal with 8 eyes specifically placed so you cant do that. Thats impressive.\nSpiders have learned how to use their web and hair to catch fish. No where is safe from the spider. \nSpiders have AMAZING camouflage abilities. Seriously. So many examples. \nThey sometimes have water droplet hats, which has nothing to do with my point yet somehow remains relevant I feel.\n\n\u200b\nThat's an impressive list. You may be tempted to write the dragonfly off in comparison and no one would blame you. But the dragonfly has a few major points in its favor as well.\n\nThe most successful hunter in the world isn't a big cat, or a fearsome shark, or a poisonous reptile. It's the dragonfly nymph, which is theorized to boast a 95% success rate. Ya, Harvard is coming down on the side of the dragonfly. Lions during the day are lucky to hit 33%, and the best packs may near 50% at night, to give some perspective, and that's high. \nDragonfly nymphs have a crazy method of attack. For those who don't want to watch a video, they have an extendable bottom jaw that shoots out at supersonic speeds. Basically, imagine your bottom jaw was another arm you could blast out and impales shit with sharp mandibles. If that isn't the most metal thing you've heard all day I salute you. \n Since dragonflies hunt mosquitos both during the larval stage and adult stage their numbers would likely be higher than anticipated. \n\nHonestly, I have no idea who I'd give the edge to. Spiders get variety, but damn is dragonfly hunting cool. \n"", 'I dont like spiders over other insects, but in case of frikkin mobility: there is this desert spider, which can go downhill awesomely fast by ""wheeling"" itself. \nCant explain any better, but just imagine being a bug, save and sound about a buglightyear away from the next predator when suddenly a rolling wheel of spidery doom approaches out of nowhere, screeming ""Geronimo!"" and missing you (no breaks) by an inch or so... seems more terrifying than those little ponddragons.\n', 'Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/AnythingApplied (80∆).\nDelta\xa0System\xa0Explained | Deltaboards\n', 'Dragonflies have also kept their form (though a few size changes) for like 250 million years.\nI agree with you, dragonflies are dope as hell, they’re actually one of the most successful hunters in existence catching over 95% of the prey they pursue! \n', ""\nWell how else can I judge them if not with a species wide average?\n\nYou're judging them on their order.

Also, they buzz around from place to place, which can be annoying while you're just resting and watching a movie.

So then that makes it seem like the issue is with the accusations of B derailing the conversation or with them saying ""I never said it was true for all X"". \nYou said ""Firstly, it\'s not clear what the speaker actually means.""

People understand what the speaker means. Speech is nothing more than a tool to share thoughts. As long as the parties involved understand the meaning of what a speaker said, the actual words used are, and should be irrelevant. \nTypically speaking, when a person confronts someone when using a stereotype, they almost always know what the other speaker meant. They’re usually just uncomfortable with a stereotype being used for various reasons, it’s not an attempt to narrow down thoughts. \nFor example, I’ve probably heard some version of “black people are X” hundreds, if not thousands of times in my lifetime. \nNot once however have I ever believed that the person who made the comment, literally believes that every black person is that thing. \nI also don’t believe in all the times I’ve seen someone respond with the “but not all blacks are X’s,” did that person believe the other meant it literally. \nIt’s simply a game people play when they when they wish to act self righteous.

There are plenty of “racial” stereotypes however. \nI’ll try to answer the question though. \nIt depends on the conversation and each persons goals. \nIf you wish to change the conversation to a debate on the use of stereotypes, then it’s perfectly fine to call out the use of a stereotype. \nHowever, if a conversation is being had, and someone uses a stereotype to make a specific point on a topic, I don’t believe the other party should disregard the points the speaker was trying to communicate, and use semantics to steer the conversation elsewhere. \nIt can be quite useful to speak in generalities, as it allows conversations to progress rapidly. \nWe all use stereotypes consciously and subconsciously on a daily basis.

28,Klinging-on,"I imagine the Aliens as either a slightly more technologically advanced species or a ""hive"" species. In the former technological gap between humanity and these aliens would be about the difference between WW2 era to now. The second alien species would be a hive-mind type which would have the advantage of adaptability and very fast population growth with the necessary resources. The second is comparable to the Zerg from Starcraft, Flood from Halo, Xenomorph from the Alien franchise, Bugs from Starship troopers, etc. I think humanity would eventually win if either of the Aliens invaded and that there would be benefits to the invasion. Humanity would put aside their differences and combine their forces to resist the alien invasion. This would be unprecedented in human history and allow for a closer, less xenophobic world. The Aliens would wipe out a good percentage of humanity before they were beaten back. This would end some of the major issues of our time such as climate change and overpopulation, which threaten to create instability and kill good amounts of humanity themselves.Economic inequality would decrease, leading to a more stable society. WW2 destroyed huge amounts of physical capital through bombs and guns, financial wealth through inflation, and human capital through all the human lives it took. However after all this economic inequality in the US and Europe was at its lowest ever. As a result we had a stable society (this happened in WW1 as well, read Picketty's Capital in the 21st century for more on this).If the Aliens are the technologically advanced species, the race to reverse their technologically could further humanity. To beat the technologically advanced species I states above, we would need to force them to deploy ground forces to delay while we reverse engineer their technology as fast as possible. I'm not sure how we would do the former, the latter would be huge benefit to humanity. We would suddenly have the technology for inter-space travel, deadly precise weapons, self-sustainment, and all the side technologies and derivatives of these.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

29,Klinging-on,"I imagine the Aliens as either a slightly more technologically advanced species or a ""hive"" species. In the former technological gap between humanity and these aliens would be about the difference between WW2 era to now. The second alien species would be a hive-mind type which would have the advantage of adaptability and very fast population growth with the necessary resources. The second is comparable to the Zerg from Starcraft, Flood from Halo, Xenomorph from the Alien franchise, Bugs from Starship troopers, etc. I think humanity would eventually win if either of the Aliens invaded and that there would be benefits to the invasion. Humanity would put aside their differences and combine their forces to resist the alien invasion. This would be unprecedented in human history and allow for a closer, less xenophobic world. The Aliens would wipe out a good percentage of humanity before they were beaten back. This would end some of the major issues of our time such as climate change and overpopulation, which threaten to create instability and kill good amounts of humanity themselves.Economic inequality would decrease, leading to a more stable society. WW2 destroyed huge amounts of physical capital through bombs and guns, financial wealth through inflation, and human capital through all the human lives it took. However after all this economic inequality in the US and Europe was at its lowest ever. As a result we had a stable society (this happened in WW1 as well, read Picketty's Capital in the 21st century for more on this).If the Aliens are the technologically advanced species, the race to reverse their technologically could further humanity. To beat the technologically advanced species I states above, we would need to force them to deploy ground forces to delay while we reverse engineer their technology as fast as possible. I'm not sure how we would do the former, the latter would be huge benefit to humanity. We would suddenly have the technology for inter-space travel, deadly precise weapons, self-sustainment, and all the side technologies and derivatives of these.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.
