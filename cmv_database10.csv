0,Admira1Jackbar,"There are two components to my argument. First, I believe that releasing the results, in the manner that she did, will strategically/politically hurt her chances in 2020.Second, I believe the way in which she has sold her Native American ancestry is morally wrong.How should Warren have proceeded? I believe that she could have publicized her results without coming off as offensive and culturally incompetent. She could have used the video to honestly explain that her family had hyperbolized her Native American roots, that she does not identify as Native American, and that she has not been oppressed in any way because of her ancestry. This has been a rambling post, but I think ya'll get my major points.​Edit#1: Thank you so much all for engaging in this conversation. I have tried to respond to as many posts as I can but unfortunately have to get back to studying. My perspective is largely unchanged but I will continue trying to respond when I can. Furthermore, there has been some misinformation about the DNA test results and how they are interpreted. One user linked me this article, which has a great breakdown of what the test means. In summary, it is much more likely that Warren is 1/64th native American as opposed to 1/500th or 1/1,000 Native American. This doesn't really change my main points, but it is good to get the facts straight.​Edit#2: This boston globe article has a good summary of the situation at hand. A lot of people are saying that she has never identified as Native American, but that is contradictory to this relevant passage: ""In an interview with the Globe published last month, Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many of the matriarchs of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories and history were becoming lost. Ivy League universities, like the ones where Warren taught, were under great pressure to show they had diverse staffs.The University of Pennsylvania filled out a document explaining why it hired a white woman over minority candidates — clear evidence it didn’t view her as a Native American addition. And the Globe interviewed 31 Harvard Law School faculty members who voted on her appointment there, and all said her heritage was not a factor.""So, while I don't think it's likely that her career has been significantly furthered by claims to Native American heritage, the fact is that she has identified as Native American historically. I believe that she should have addressed this in her video and been explicit that it was a mistake to ever identify as Native American. Also, before you comment, I would strongly recommend reading the two articles I have linked as they provide most of the information you need to know.

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\'t generally go down well in MA. \nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\'s consider that she\'s got no 2020 plans.\nIf her seat is safe and she\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\'re beating on ""Pocahontas"" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MS), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \nSo Warren\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \nThat\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway. It makes more sense if she doesn\'t plan on running. \n', ""Hmm. Interesting take. I guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing. While I stand by my statement my moral objections to the way she went about this, I think that if indeed she isn't going to run in 2020 this strategy makes more sense. \n"", ""\nI guess I will award you a conditional delta if that's a thing.\n\nI'm not sure how you'd go about a conditional delta, but if they made you see things from a different light, consider awarding an actual delta. Delta doesn't mean compete transversal and you don't have to wait around until 2020 and be 100% convinced to give it.\n"", 'Just add !\\delta (without the slash), to the previous comment.\n', 'My bad never posted here before\n', ""I guess the moral component would depend on how successful the strategy is. If she can distract enough GOP hate to somehow help the Democrats win all of their competitive races and get back a Senate majority, she would have played a part in making sure that no more Kavanaughs happen between now and 2020. \nIf you see that as a good thing (as she surely does), then you could argue that she's doing a morally questionable action for the sake of a larger moral victory. In the end, the extent of damage she does here is frustrating a percentage of the Native American community for a few months. If the strategy works and the Dems take the Senate, there's the potential to prevent things that are way more damaging than that. So you could argue that going for the strategy would be a moral good. . . in aggregate (if not in isolation). \n"", ""Sure - I hereby award one !delta for giving me a new perspective. If it is the case that she is not going through with a 2020 bid, I believe that this might help other democrats in their respective campaigns by eating up news realestate that would otherwise be focused on them. Since Warren's seat is probably safe, the negative attention on her doesn't really matter for her personal political strategy. However, I don't believe that this was her strategy intentionally, rather, I believe this might be one positive consequence of an overall poor decision. I think it's more likely that Warren went through with this whole thing to advance her personal agenda rather than as some altruistic distraction. Furthermore, you mentioned the ND race - I think that's where this whole thing might be the most detrimental. If Native Americans votes are swayed by this whole thing or their enthusiasm is at all reduced, it hurts Heitkamp's chances.\n"", 'I think the main strategic advantage of Warren’s decision is that it disarms one of Trump’s primary avenues of attack, name calling. Pocahontas has been Trump’s go to name for Warren for quite a while. If Warren brings up the million dollar donation every time Trump says Pocahontas she either galvanized her base by continuing to point out that Trump is a hypocrite or pushes Trump away from using that name. Either possibility is beneficial. \n', ""Hmm.. I don't think Trump will stop using Pocahantas. I think he and his supporters will persist b/c in their eyes Warren is no more Native American than she was prior to the DNA results. Furthermore, the bet was that Trump would pay if the DNA showed she was 'an Indian'. Since you can't prove that with a DNA test as it is mostly a cultural/experiential identity, there is no way to win or lose the bet. Warren has legitimized the ridiculous bet by engaging with it and bending to Trump's requests. \n"", 'The issue is that you’re looking too far ahead.\nThe big hurdle for Warren to be president is getting on the ballot by winning the Democrat primary. \nHaving the Trump base attack her, while simultaneously adding some validity to her ancestry claim gives her some credit in the eyes of Dems as someone the right hates and protects her from attacks within her own party. You’re not going to convince Trump supporters that she’s an Indian, but you might trick one of her primary challengers to fall for the bait of contesting her claim. If a Dem starts arguing that she can’t be Indian because she doesn’t have enough ‘blood’, the identity politics wing of the party will cannibalize them.\nDefeating Trump is a matter of a lot of factors out of her control and more about how the Dems vs Reps mobilize and how current events and news sway voters. The primary is much more about her individually and where she needs to focus her efforts. This does that.\n', ""Hmmm I'm not sure I follow your argument. So you think that this whole thing will benefit her in the primaries b/c a  another democrat might bring up the illegitimacy of her claims? I honestly don't see any democrat trying to touch this issue in a debate (the damage has been done and they wouldn't want to give her anymore room to soften the issue) and based off how left wing media is covering this I don't think it has won her many points with liberals. Perhaps the increased criticism from right wing media will drum up tribal support from democrats as passion begets passion, but I still think the net result will be negative. \n"", 'Trump’s exact quote doesn’t ask her to prove tribal membership, but specifically mentions a DNA test\n“We will take that little [DNA] kit, but we have to do it gently. Because we’re in the #MeToo generation so we have to be very gentle. And we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t injure her arm even though it only weighs probably two ounces. And we will say: I will give you a million dollars, paid for by Trump, to your favorite charity, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian.”\n', ""Yes... and she wins the bet if the DNA test 'shows you're an Indian'. Since we have established that there is no definition of what would qualify as Indian, it is an impossible bet to win or lose. Different tribes have different metrics. It can show that she has a Native American in her ancestry, but that's not what Trump said. \n"", 'Thats such a bs excuse. Especialy since hes said other times that he thinks she has less native ancestry then him, and he has none. \nIf the same people that are ""pissed off"" at Warren kept Trump to the same standard he wouldn\'t have made it out of the primary. \n', ""But I'm not comparing Warren vs. Trump, I'm comparing Warren vs. every other 2020 hopeful. I believe that this whole thing has been a strategic blunder and is not the correct way to engage with Trump. This whole thing has made me less sure that Warren would do well 1v1 with Trump. \n"", 'If you step back just a bit.   Warren liability is the Pocahontas’s thing,  Trumps liabilities dwarf hers.     It’s amazing this is presented as a debate of two equivalent candidates. \n', ""I agree it's ridiculous, but that doesn't change the fact that it's important and I think Warren could have handled it way better. \n"", ""You can prove you are Native American by DNA, if your percentage is high enough. You are indigenous to the US if you predominantly descend from the original inhabitants of the US. You can't be Native American solely by culture. Of course, this means Warren is not indigenous and just has some minute indigenous ancestry.\n"", ""I should clarify - I acknowledge that the DNA test is good at showing what percent of your DNA is from Native American ancestors. However, there is no solid definition for whether or not someone is Native American. Short of being 100% genetically Native American, there are many different metrics used by various tribes to determine if someone qualifies. So what metric would be used in this bet? How could Warren win the bet? She can't b/c it's a nonsense bet made with no qualifications and whoever wins is completely arbitrary. \n"", 'She herself clearly stated, she has native ancestry, but does not belong to any tribe and does not claim to have any status with any tribe. \nIt\'s only being brought up by conservatives as an attack because they have nothing else on her, but she is now bringing it up because it has been a perfect demonstration of how Trump lies and contradicts himself: years of calling her out on it and demanding a DNA test, offering a million dollars only to say ""who cares?"" and ""I never said that, read it again"" with numerous videos of the contrary. It further chips away at his credibility with those not an unwavering supporter.\nFor someone who claims to be so wealthy to refuse to give (a ""small loan"" worth) to a CHARITY does not shine a good light on his character.  \n', 'The point is that Trump calling her ""Pocahontas"" was a jab that assumed she was lying about her Native American ancestry for some sort of gain (although there is pretty decent reporting showing that Warren did not gain benefits from telling the truth on forms from the 80s that she had Native American ancestors).\nIt isn\'t exactly important how large a percentage of Native American Warren is, because the argument was never what percentage Native American is Warren. The question, as posed by Republicans including Trump, was whether or not Warren could realistically claim to have had Native American ancestors. According to the DNA results, she can.\nMany people are now trying to shift the argument to be about the question about what percentage of Native American you have to be to claim to be Native, but that isn\'t correct at all. Calling someone Pocahontas because it has racial overtones and almost sounds demeaning isn\'t something to back down from. And even if the argument the whole time was that Warren doesn\'t have enough recent Native American ancestors, isn\'t that accusations enough by itself when coming from the POTUS to rise up and defend your heritage and family history? Why should any individual in this country be ashamed of their great great grandparents or their great great great grandparents just because of their ethnicity?\nThose are a lot of words, but it is so wrong that any individual should feel ashamed for not burying their past. It isn\'t that Warren actively promoted herself (although others ran a little wild) as a Native American, so shouldn\'t we all be at least a little disgusted that anyone would attack her for just her acknowledgement that one of her distant ancestors fell in love with a Native American?\n', 'You’re probably right about Trump sticking to Pocahontas. And you’re probably right that engaging with this bet legitimizes Trump’s words. But Trump is the president. His words have some inherent legitimacy or at least significance. If Warren can make people remember those words as a failed promise she made a sound choice.\nI don’t think the minutia of Trump’s statement matters too much. Warren took a DNA test that validated the story she has been saying about her ancestry, the same story Donald Trump makes fun of. That won’t mean much to Trump supporters, but to people actually on the fence or Warren’s supporters it means She has been telling an accurate truth for years, which does seem meaningful.\nIf Warren does decide to go for a Presidential run in 2020 I think the tactic of making Trump eat his words could serve her well. This seems like a first step in that kind of strategy. \n', ""I'm have no level of respect for Trump, but the donation was based on proof of being Native American. A maximum of 1/64 Native American ancestry is not being a Native American anymore than I am French due to my mother's great great great great great grandfather being from France. The last one of my ancestors who considered themselves French died before the War of 1812.\nElizabeth Warren is not Native American, she has no tribal connections, no cultural connections and no blood connections within the last century. Trump is very, very rarely justified in his actions but if I had made the bet I wouldn't pay out either.\n"", ""> It gives the right a ton of ammo for attack adds and talking points. They can now say that Warren has benefited from her claim of Native American heritage while being scarcely Native American\nWe're weeks into this thing and no one has shown that Harvard even has an affirmative action plan for Native Americans. In fact, all I can find on AA is that they lower test score requirements for students from poor, rural and sparsely populated areas.\n"", ""I'm not making an assertion that she benefited from her claims to Native American history - that's actually irrelevant to my argument. I think it is pretty clear, however, that this whole thing has made it easier for right wing pundits to say that she has benefited. In the past, she has identified as Native American on applications (one or more times, i'm not sure and it doesn't matter). Thus, she has identified as Native American while having no real cultural or genetic basis for doing so. This is very easily spun by pundits - if you don't believe me, go to Breitbart of Fox News or Ben Shapiro's channel right now. \n"", ""\nIn the past, she has identified as Native American on applications (one or more times, i'm not sure and it doesn't matter)\n\nIt does matter, and the number is zero applications.\nWhy does it matter? Because it makes your concern about right-wing spin irrelevant, and even better, the spin becomes obvious trolling.

And yea - I guess she would be crucified by right wing media no matter what, but the fact there is some truth to this (not that she benefited, but that she had identified as a minority before when she isn\'t) means it will gain more traction and land more heavily, espicially when such media reaches undecided voters. \n', ""I'm conservative, and African American.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a pretty minor issue. There's no evidence she tried to use this status to her financial benefit, to help her career, or that she identified as Native American in any other situation. Her colleagues and superiors say they knew her as a white woman. She never tried to obtain tribal citizenship or identify with any tribal nation in a legal sense.\nShe claims she did it in hopes that she might connect with other people of Native American descent, since she knew it was part of her family history and wanted to learn more. You can believe her or not, but again there's nothing to suggest she used this to advance her career.\nAs someone with experience in genetic genealogy, I would say her DNA results do in fact validate her Native American heritage. The report shows she very likely had a Native American ancestor 6-10 generations back. You might be thinking that's pretty far removed, but hear me out.\nWhen this whole thing popped up during Warren's senate campaign, she talked about how her family always told her they were part Native American. Genealogists started digging and discovered that Warren's great great great grandmother was allegedly Native American (her name was O.C. Sarah Smith). There was no solid proof, but it seems to be a common claim passed down among this woman's descendants. If this ancestor was full blooded, that would make Warren 1/32nd Native American. However, genealogists seem to agree that she wasn't full blooded. If this ancestor was half Native American, that would make Warren 1/64th Native American, which would mean Warren is 6 generations removed from a full blooded Native American ancestor. This fits with the DNA test, so it's totally plausible this ancestor (Warren's 3x great grandmother) was half Native American.\nA great great great grandmother is not as far removed as you might think. One of my great great grandmothers was still alive when I was born - I even have a picture of her holding me as a baby! I know all about this side of the family, because she lived so long. This is only one generation less than Warren's supposed Native American ancestor, so it's not unrealistic at all that the family might still be well aware of their heritage, and consider it to be a significant part of their identity. There would be physical traits, stories passed down, names... all of it eventually dwindling away generation by generation, but they still held onto the identity. If they openly shared this fact, it's not hard to imagine some unfavorable opinions when Warren's parents married in 1932.\nJust like many Native Americans who assimilated into European-American society, Warren's ancestors left no paper trail. If they didn't want to to be persecuted or discriminated against, they would do anything they could to fit in without a trace. It wasn't until relatively recently that it became acceptable or desirable to claim Native American ancestry. There are tons of families just like Warren's, who don't have it documented, but know through oral tradition. You can put all kinds of political spin on it, but it's hard to deny there's something amazing about DNA backing up oral family history from at least 6 generations ago, and that's the main thing I take away from this whole issue.\nIt's true that Warren is mostly of European descent, but at no point did Warren lie about this. Nothing she said has been proven wrong or even misleading... if anything, it's all been reinforced by DNA evidence.\nOn the other hand, strategically I would agree with you. Republicans don't care about facts or science. They will build their own narrative, and Warren is just fanning the flames by responding at all. Democrats aren't going to win by arguing with idiots. They win by talking passionately about important issues, and presenting a better vision for the future.\n"", ""Yup, I've come around to the conclusion that Warren hasn't benefited from or exaggerated her claims of Native American ancestry.

So I didn\'t try to draw correlation there. I\'m saying that she both is <1% NA and she hasn\'t had tribal involvement. \nIn terms of why this strikes me as immoral, I had two points. First, she is overplaying minority status for personal gain. When she chose to identify as Native American in the 80\'s, she knew that, at most, her great great great grandmother was Native American. Now, with the release of this video, she is overplaying her Native American roots and making a huge scene out of having 1/64th Native American DNA max. To me, that is capitalizing on minority status that isn\'t there and hasn\'t tangibly affected her. That is immoral. Second, by not having more conversations with Native Americans when making this video, she has unduly offended many Native Americans. Is it immoral to unduly offend an oppressed minority? I tend to believe so. \n', 'Sure, but that doesn’t refute my point. That’s a relative argument. \n', 'I think you\'re assuming that there\'s the nothing option, the test option, and then another better option?\nI don\'t think that doing nothing is a good choice. Lots of democrats have tried to rise above the petty bickering, even some more moderate republicans in the last presidential primary tried. Where did it get them? No where, they lost because to some decent percentage of American voters any claim needs to be answered. Any unanswered claim seems like an admission of guilt. Are those voters uninformed idiots? Maybe, but the strategy of ""just make up bullshit and force the other person to refute it"" seems to have been working for the last couple election cycles (at least). So ""nothing"" isn\'t an option.\nTaking a test and proving that there\'s truth to her story at least takes the idea that she\'s just lying off the table. That\'s essentially been the claim coming from the right, and her counter claim, as far as I can tell has been:\n\nMy family always said that there was native american ancestory on my mother\'s side\nIt was such an issue that she said back in 2012 her father\'s family wasn\'t going to let him marry her mom, and they had to elope. And apparently it continued to be an issue her entire life because it also caused some problem at her mother\'s funeral. \nShe never claimed to be part of a tribe or ever claimed any kind of cultural heritage\nShe really hasn\'t mentioned it much at all in her entire career, and the only reason it\'s an issue at all is that republicans went looking for dirt from her past, and this is the best that they could come up.\n\nSo, I\'m not sure what a better option would be? Let the other party continue to mock her, call her a lie, make up shit about her without responding at all? Try to give a civil answer? Because that\'s what she was doing for the last 4 years.\nWhat\'s a better option than just definitively settling the truth, she\'s has a tiny bit of native american ancestry, which is basically what she\'s been saying the whole time. If someone wants to go put in the effort to disprove her claim that her parents eloped, then that would be real news. Because otherwise I can\'t see how she\'s done anything even remotely wrong.\n', ""I don't think the 'nothing' option would have been all that bad and I actually think it would have been better than what she ended up doing. By doing nothing, the issue would have gotten, overall, less attention in independent and liberal circles and would have remained more isolated in Republican circles. However, I think 'nothing' was a second best option. What would be a better option? She could have come right out and acknowledged that the extent of her Native American ties was overplayed in family lore. She could have consulted with tribal leaders and people more knowledgable in this topic in order to publish her results in a way that didn't feel so tone deaf. While she never says she belongs to a tribe, she does say she has Native American heritage. While this is true, it feels very uncomfortable to make that claim without a large asterisk every time noting that it is a very distant heritage. She has also checked boxes (one box?) in her college applications identifying as Native American - she should have acknowledged that this was wrong and then emphasized that at no other time past that point in her professional career did she capitalize on this identity (which she did in her video, but without acknowledging that she had identified as Native American when she shouldn't have). \n"", ""\nIn her release video, she claims that the DNA results validate her Native American heritage.

I can't find any instance of her making this claim. I think that sometimes she may have abbreviated the term, but she never claimed to be Native American any more than by heritage.

Scott Brown, as you may remember, was a major player in the original iteration of this whole controversy some eight years ago during Warren\'s original run for US Senate against Brown.\nFinally, I want to challenge the notion that she has ""...never suffered any oppression that actual Native Americans suffer.""\nFirst, she is an actual Native American, both in terms of family lore (not under question), and now due to result of her genetic background. That she is not registered with a tribe is a separate issue from her self-identifying as having Native ancestry.\nSecond, her lived experiences and her family stories have shown that she was brought up in a lower middle-class upbringing, and that she did indeed face hardships as a teenager. A further point is that, whatever your opinion of it, affirmative action is not just meant to help a person out because of their direct struggles--it is also meant as a means to rectify generations of past disadvantages suffered by one\'s whole family. It can take generations for a family to come out of poverty, for example, and to the extent this issue (or similar issues) faced Warren\'s family, then even if she had used her Native ancestry for political gain (which I do not think she did, but that\'s a separate question), then that still may have been appropriate\n', ""Multiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered Native Americans and her parents told her they eloped because her paternal side of the family did not like that her mom was part Cherokee/Delaware. That sort of thing does impact how you form your own identity and affect how you view race.\nThere hasn't been a single colleague of hers that has come forward and said she was hired because of affirmative action. \nNative Americans groups have been on every side of the issue because they agree it's also hard to verify native ancestry by the paper trail as well , but don't want members of their tribe kicked out over DNA tests which Elizabeth Warren has said she is against.\n"", ""\nMultiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered Native Americans\n\n\u200b\nDo you have a cite for that? Because I've never seen that claim anywhere. From my own reading, her claim was to a single ancestor several generations back.\n"", ""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/08/brown-continues-offense-on-warren-over-native-american-claims/\n\nThe New England Historic Genealogical Society provided CNN with initial research last week, showing several members of Warren’s maternal family claiming Cherokee heritage. The Native American link extends to Warren’s great-great-great grandmother O.C. Sarah Smith, who is said to be described as Cherokee in an 1894 marriage license application. NEHGS gathered that information through a 2006 family newsletter, and says the original application cannot be located.\n\nYou can't just have one ancestor 5 generations back be native American that would make all of her ancestors on that side native american.\n"", ""Warren was totally honest and forthright. She didn't hide the numbers and released them. The people who are upset about that issue are basically saying she should be more Native American than she was. Does that in fact make her a liar? And how the hell can this reasoning only apply to Warren but not to the countless lies Trump told about his own background?\n"", 'It was strategically stupid. I am not sure what game the Dems are playing but they seem incompetent at this point. Letting Hillary continue to talk is equally as incompetent.

It is fallacious to make the claim that she is stooping to their level when Republicans won\'t even rise up and have some courtesy and decency as statesmen.\nNo, what Elizabeth Warren did was fine. If you should have any issues you should be upset at Mitch McConnell.     \n\nMcConnell said it would be ""very difficult to do entitlement reform, and we’re talking about Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid,"" with one party in charge of Congress and the White House.

I might be able to change your view about the strategic value, though.\nFirst, consider that in all polling up to October 7th, Warren is beating her opponent by at least 20 points. Anything is possible, but it\'s very unlikely that many people in MA are going to change their votes based on silly drama like this. Especially when her opponent is kind of a Trumpian candidate, which doesn\'t generally go down well in MA. \nAgain, it certainly is possible that this move costs her the seat, but statistically it\'s pretty unlikely. Her seat is considered safe barring some black swan event. \nSecond, people are all assuming that Warren plans to run in 2020. I don\'t necessarily think she will. Her main passion is the CFPB and financial legislation, and she could really do more for that in the Senate than in the White House. So let\'s consider that she\'s got no 2020 plans.\nIf her seat is safe and she\'s NOT running in 2020, then the strategy of this move makes a lot of sense: she\'s doing this to draw fire from Trump and the right-wing hate machine. The more they\'re beating on ""Pocahontas"" and venting their rage onto her, the less attention they can focus on people like Bill Nelson (FL), Claire McCaskill (MS), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND). These are all Democrats in red or purple states whose races are quite competitive, and where a focused right-wing media campaign is much more likely to tip the scales than in MA. \nSo Warren\'s actual strategy here is to troll Trump and the FOXbart machine into wasting time, money, and resources on her. If she can keep them frothing at the mouth and raging at her, it gives the Dems in less secure seats more cover. \nThen she keeps her seat, puts on her trollface, and doesn\'t even enter the primary in 2020. So all of the sound and fury truly signifies nothing. \nThat\'s my take on the strategic move here, anyway.

1,DuvetShmuvet,"Lately (over the few recent years) I've been hearing talk about how one of the most likely doomsday scenarios for the human race will by a super-intelligent AI.
I like Elon Musk, but I think he's way wrong on this. In my opinion, there is little to no danger of an AI being the cause of humanity's extinction or near-extinction.Here is my reasoning: in order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings. Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes. Theoretically, this weapon would have super-human intelligence but otherwise be incorporeal (using the computing resources of the world's computers as its brain). Let's assume that it does ""escape the lab"" or ""go rogue"" and for some reason decides that it wants to do as much damage to humanity as possible (why would it? Presumably that would be against its programming after all). What can this AI do? Well, let's assume, since it is super-intelligent, it can get into 100% of the world's internet-connected computer systems. The internet becomes one huge botnet. What next?Exactly...what next? Most modern military weaponry isn't remotely controlled, let alone internet-connected, and implementing these features in modern weaponry with the exception of drones (of which there is a very small amount compared to the rest of the military) would be undesirable, so it won't happen.Any rogue remotely controlled drones/devices would be put down with ease by the existing human military.So what else can the AI do? Disrupt infrastructure. Yes, except only developed countries have a significant amount of their infrastructure on internet-connected devices. Most of the world would have no problem either switching back to traditional paper-based systems or just carrying on using them because they never were fully computerized.The amount of infrastructure, globally, that would be affected would be pretty small and even though not easily rectifiable, it would cause negligible harm to the human race as a whole.Lastly: IF the AI took over everything, IF it was kill or be killed - all the humans need to do is snip the cables and shut off the power. The AI is incorporeal, it can't stop a mammal with wire cutters, or a physical switch in a power station.Humanity would prevail. Even in the absolute worst case scenario where it could theoretically kill off the human race (though I believe this scenario to be impossible for the reasons above) the humans would just kill it first.This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

If the AI is improving itself and decides its goal is to destroy humans, why would it make some silly mistake in execution of its plan? I don\'t know if you are familiar with the Deep Mind AI projects, but their Go program beat the world champion a couple years back. Its ability to play is a ""black box"". No one in the world understands how it plays Go, it just does. That computer program has more Go knowledge than the entire human race. It is possible that a general super intelligence could develop a way to fight us that we have not conceived. Isn\'t it almost by definition that a super-intelligence will be able to think of things that we haven\'t?\n', ""\nWhy would it make some silly mistake\n\nVery intelligent does not mean infallible. It could be near-perfect in its judgement, but it will never be omniscient. It would definitely be capable of making mistakes.\n\nIt is possible that a general super intelligence could develop a way to fight us that we have not conceived\n\nThis is true, but it is also true in any human-human conflict. There is always the possibility that our opponent will outsmart us. In my opinion, the collective intelligence of human beings is such that we would be able to counteract the AI.\nFor example, the Go program (thank you, I was not familiar with it): nobody might understand how it plays Go, currently. How many people are actively researching its method? I would wager not too many. I think, should humanity decide that playing Go optimally is crucial to the advancement or survival of our species, the resources poured into studying methods of playing Go and the methods of the Deep Mind AI would very quickly uncover what's going on. \n"", 'What i oppose is your absolute opinion that it ""Will Not happen"", it is my opinion that it is possible.\nI disagree about the Go study. I suspect most, if not every, professional Go player is studying the AIs games in an attempt to gain an advantage over their human peers. Deep mind made a special kind of processor they call a tensor processing unit (TPU) in order to handle the processing of the neural network. Humans are not physically capable of doing the processing the computer is doing in real time.\nYou talked about the doomsday scenarios, I think one of the better ones was in Terminator 3. Spoiler alert: the AI made the defense computers act weird and tricked the humans into thinking they were being hacked by a rival nation. They thought maybe the AI could help them ward off the threat so they transferred the computers over to the AI which then took over.\n', ""\nVery intelligent does not mean infallible. It could be near-perfect in its judgement, but it will never be omniscient. It would definitely be capable of making mistakes.\n\nYes, but it wouldn't step into HUGE mistakes such as letting us know that it is trying to kill all humans before it had all but made sure it couldn't be shut down.\nSo it very well may play the long game and pretend to be friendly while it seizes control in ways that aren't apparent.\nIt actually wouldn't be too hard for the AI to get to the point where a coordinated effort could shut it down, but can't because it has removed our ability to coordinate on that level.  It would hide what its doing so people don't know it's evil, it would use propaganda to make us think it is good, it would pay people to improve it and give it more tools and may disguise itself so people don't know they are working for an AI.  So while one country may be making progress in purging the AI from its computer systems, the people in another country may be building it controllable robots and may not even realize what they're doing.\nHow hard would it be to, before doing anything else remotely suspicious, the first couple actions might be to make some money (stock market, hacking banking systems, etc) and using that money to start building robots in some remote chinese factory for it to control.  It could arrange it all by email and the people may not even know they're working for an AI.  With enough robots, the AI could start up its own factory with the robots and start turning out a robot army all the while it appears to be behaving normally in its normal tasks to the people that built it.\n"", ""\nHere is my reasoning: in order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings. Meaning, it would have to be developed as a weapon for military purposes.\n\nNo. It would not, if an AI running a factory or group of factories dumps toxic waste into our water supply we are as good as dead. There are literally tons of regular practical non-military applications where an AI can even mistakenly make a decision and lead us to an untimely death as a species.\nThe AI doomsday isn't going to be like Terminator. It's going to be much more boring and accidental.\nFacebook was messing around with a linguistics AI that invented its own language completely by accident. The AI began to communicate to one another using English, but the developed a sub language because it was more efficient for completing the designed task.\nIt's something like like this where the AI does something at an inopportune time as a malfunction that can cause the AI doomsday.\n"", ""To be fair, I understand that if humans automated everything, and then connect everything to one network, a super-intelligent AI could do serious damage.\nHowever, why in the hell would humanity do such a thing. You automate everything in a network of factories to the point that in case of a synchronized software failure it's possible that all of them dump toxic waste in human water supply? What kind of moron would design such a system?\nBesides, that also would have relatively localized effects, nowhere near affecting humanity as a whole, maybe just the local town.\n"", 'I believe an AI ""consciously"" deciding to wage war on humanity is unlikely.  More likely would be machine learning algorithms built into new and future weapons misinterpreting the intents of humans using them.\nThere is a huge strategic advantage in having ""smart"" weapons that can make decisions without human intervention.  Drones can react much faster if a human does not need to be ""in the loop"" for all decisions.  Furthermore, the more automated the decision making becomes, the more drones a single person would be able to control, increasing their effectiveness in combat.\nEventually this could continue until the humans ""in the loop"" are controlling less than 50% or the decision making process.  At this point, who is controlling the war, man or machine?\nIf it progressed far enough, the humans ""in the loop"" may not be able to predict and/or stop the actions of their drone fleets.  They may even be controlling so many that they will not know the specific actions of any of them.\nI doubt an AI will just ""decide"" to take over.  More likely, we would hand them control over a long period of time.\n', ""That's a fair point, and a much more likely scenario. However, I still don't believe this drone fleet would threaten more than a negligible portion of humanity.\nThe drones, should they want to perform military strikes against humans in general, will run out of ammo. Unless at some point in the future all ammo factories, forklifts, transport trucks, loaders, etc. are automated, the drones will simply quickly run out of ammo and be harmless.\n"", 'Why the AI would not figure out how to mine minerals for ammo and build more factories?\n', ""With what resources? How would it build factories if all factories are built by humans and there are no robots capable of doing the job? \nThe only world where an AI could take on humanity is one where we have robot workers that can basically do what humans can, which I don't think will ever happen until a post-scarcity society is achieved.\n"", ""The scenario I'm envisioning is a total war similar to WWI or WWII.  The military powers involved would want to automate as much as possible, including the ammunition production and delivery to the drone combatants.  All these would be logical military progression of automation and likely would have been attempted in the World Wars if the technology existed at the time.  Potentially, even if a population were exterminated, the automated drone/munition production and combat would continue fighting until the entire supply chain was destroyed.\n"", ""\nHere is my reasoning: in order to maximize the chances of the AI wiping out humanity, it would have to be developed to have the ability for killing human beings.

Presumably that would be against its programming after all)\n\nI mean an AI would do what’s in it’s programing, but the programing might evolve.

The terrorists throw it on an appropriate USB drive, leave it in the parking lot, it gets inserted, and now the AI has nuclear weapons.\nOr the government might have made it itself. For example, you have an AI that’s told to kill all members of Al-Qaeda, wherever they are. Even if they are hiding in caves in Afghanistan or whatever.  It has access to the nuclear weapons, and decides the most expedient course of action is a nuclear winter. Massive fallout, huge atmospheric dust cloud, humans go bye bye (but so do all members of Al-Qaeda). \n\nIf humans left nuclear missiles connected to a network which would enable them to be launched with anything but manual operation, the AI could use them.

Most of this hinges on the fact that soon AI will be operating at well above our capacity to respond to it and control it in ways that we would typically respond to problems and control tools. With no regulation, it is certain that AI will be developed that will create more AI in order to more efficiently complete goals. Moreover, it is certain that AI will be created that will be tasked with creating other AI that are better at creating AI to complete tasks.

If the AI finds a method to jump the air gap - that is, if it can find a way to upload new software into an isolated military network, then it can take control of whatever hardware it can get access to. \nThere are several ways it might do that, and it has essentially unlimited time to think about it and plan. It could trick an unsuspecting human into plugging a compromised device into a machine on the network, or find a willing saboteur.

Thus, hair style being a tradition passed down from history isn't a really good reason as to why men are supposed to have shorter hair.Gendering hair doesn't make any symbolic sense either. People with longer hair are able to perform the same actions without any hinderences that someone with longer hair could perform. The only thing that hair could possibly be viewed as more feminine for is the greater care needed to maintain it.

Thus, the argument ""men have short hair because women find it more attractive"" doesn\'t hold up water.\n', ""In the following I will limit my discussion to Heterosexual Cisgendered people only so I don't have to get into the weeds on evolutionary niche sexual strategies and how they evolved.\nLong healthy hair is an indicator of youth and fertility.  All Female beauty standards are meant to signal youth and fertility since the male sexuality evolved to find fertile young  fertile women attractive.  The biological function of Sex is to produce children, and all genes within the human body evolved because every single one of your ancestors survived to adulthood and successfully reproduced.  Child bearing age Healthy Fertile women are the only women that can have children.  Makeup, clothing, hair, plastic surgery, etc all try to make women look younger, healthy, and more fertile.  Clothes accentuate curves of the hips.  A .7 hip to waist ratio has been the one female beauty ideal consistent across both history an cultures.  This is because a .7 human hip to waste ratio is the widest a woman's hips and physically be and still be able to walk.  Wide hips evolved as human brain size increased.\nWomen selected males for higher intelligence, and Males selected women for fertility.  In humans our brains or sort of like Peacock Feathers.  A peacocks Feathers grew huge not because of any survival function, but as a signal for healthy genes.  If a male Peacock was able to survive with such huge feathers without getting eaten, that is a signal the male is strong and has good genes, then the female peacocks will all mate with him.  The same goes for the human brain.  Males with the highest levels of intelligence and strength were the leaders of human tribes, and the high status big brained tribal leaders got to sleep with all of the women while the lower males on the totem pole didn't.  This changed after the invention of agriculture since human survival and reproduction strategy shifted from hunter gatherer bands to agrarian towns and cities, however this is very recent and human sexuality evolved for hundreds of millions of years in the hunter gatherer society. This is why modern sexual monogamy norms had to be enforced via marriage and laws instead of people being monogamous without socially constructed artificial incentives and punishments.  Some primates are naturally monogamous, humans aren't and nether are our closes primate relatives, Chimpanzees, and Bonobos.\nLong story short long healthy hair is a female fertility indicator, which is why most men find it attractive, and the vast majority of human cultures throughout history had beauty standards with long hair in women.  Male fashion standards vary much more widely culture to culture since Female sexuality didn't evolve to reproduce with the male that is the most fertile, but rather whoever was the highest status and wealth which is a signal for good genes and high intelligence.  A high status male has genes that will ensure their sons are also high status males who have a better chance at reproducing.  Different cultures and sub cultures have different fashion for men representing status.  For some it is long hair and a beard, for others it is short hair in a suit, who can fit the most bones through their nose, decking themselves out in gold jewelry and Air Jordan's, wearing a flashy pimp suit with a cane covered in diamonds, etc.  However for women, the beauty signals nearly 100% geared toward trying to look young, healthy, and fertile and long hair is simply one of many ways of doing that.  Typically there are mostly 3 kinds of women who have short hair, Feminists, Old Ladies, and Lesbians who are deliberately not trying to get male attention.\n"", ""If I'm understanding your argument correctly, the reason why women have long hair is because it is seen as being for youth and fertility. However, this doesn't really address the male components of attraction. With the current argument, it should be that men are of any sort of length of hair and women are longer haired because that is a sign of beauty.
